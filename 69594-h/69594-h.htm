  <h2 class='c008'>PROLOGUE.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Scene I.</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The family in Palazzo Loredan, in the Grand
Canal, Venice, had finished their midday breakfast,
and coffee was brought in.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was the Marchesa Loredan, a widow, her
widowed only daughter with a little son and his
tutor, and Don Claudio Loredan, the Marchesa’s
second son. Her eldest son was married; and the
youngest, Don Enrico, was a monsignore, and
coadjutor of an old canon whom he was impatiently
waiting to succeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The breakfast had not been a cheerful one. Don
Claudio, usually the life of the family and its harmonizing
element, had been silent and preoccupied;
and Madama Loredan’s black brows had two
deep lines between them,—sure signs of a storm.</p>

<p class='c011'>She rose as the coffee was bought in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Carry a tête-à-tête down to the arbor,” she
said to the servant; and to her son, “I wish to
speak to you, Claudio.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The tutor rose respectfully, making sly but intense
signals to his pupil to do the same. But
the boy, occupied in counting the cloves of a mandarin
orange, did not choose to see them.</p>

<p class='c011'>A long window of the dining-room opened on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>balcony, and from the balcony a stair descended to
the garden. This garden, a square the width of
the house, would soon be a mass of bloom; but
spring had hardly come as yet. The little arbor
in the centre was covered with rosebuds, and the
orange-trees were in blossom. There was a table
in the arbor, with a chair at each side.</p>

<p class='c011'>Madama literally swept across the dining-room;
for she did not lift a fold of the trailing robe of
glossy white linen bordered with black velvet that
followed her imperious steps.</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Claudio was familiar with the several indications
of his mother’s moods, and he followed
in silence, carefully avoiding the glistening wake
of her progress. When she had seated herself in
the arbor, he took the chair opposite her, half
filled a little rose-colored cup with coffee, dropped
a single cube of sugar into it, stirred it with a tiny
spoon that had the Loredan shield at the end of its
slender twisted stem, and gravely set the cup before
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had not once raised his eyes to her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>She watched him with a scrutinizing gaze. He
was evidently expecting a reprimand; yet there was
neither anger nor confusion in his handsome face.
It had not lost its preoccupied and even sorrowful
expression. She sipped her coffee in silence, and
waited till he had drunk his.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You were at Ca’ Mora last evening and this
morning,” she said abruptly, when he set his cup
down.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“My master is dying!” he responded quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Madama was for a moment disconcerted. The
old professor with whom her son had for two years
been studying oriental languages was a man of
note among the learned. He had exercised a beneficial
influence over the mind of Don Claudio;
and for a while she had been glad that an enthusiasm
for study should counteract the natural downward
tendency of a life full of worldly prosperity
and its attendant temptations. Only of late had
she become aware of any danger in this intimacy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dying!” she echoed. “I did not know that
he was ill.” She hesitated a moment, then bitterness
prevailed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course his granddaughter has need of consolation,”
she added with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not seen her to-day,” Don Claudio said,
controlling himself. Then, with a sudden outburst,
“I would gladly console her!” he exclaimed,
and looked at his mother defiantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>His defiance of her was like the flash of a wax
taper on steel. Madama leaned forward and raised
a warning finger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will leave her to be consoled by her
equals,” she said. “And when her grandfather is
dead, you will see her no more. Woe to her if
you disobey me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man shrugged his shoulders to hide a
tremor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Woe to her!” repeated his mother, marking
the tremor.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Don Claudio remained silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Has she succeeded in compromising you?”
Madama asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>The quick blood covered her son’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You might, at least, refrain from slandering
her!” he exclaimed. Then his voice became supplicating.
“Mamma, all that Tacita Mora lacks
is rank. She has a fair portion; and she has been
delicately reared and guarded. Her manners are
exquisite. And there can be no undesirable connection,
for she will be quite alone in the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His mother made an impatient gesture, and was
about to speak; but he held his hands out to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mamma, I love her so!” he exclaimed. “You
do not know her. She is not one of those girls who
give a man opportunities, and are always on the
lookout for a lover. We have never spoken a word
of love. We have only looked at each other. But
I cannot lose her!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He threw himself on his knees at his mother’s
side, and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>She drew his head to her shoulder, and kissed
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have only looked at each other!” she repeated.
“My poor boy! As if that were not
enough! Claudio, we all have to go through with
it, as with teething. It is a madness. The only
safe way is to follow the counsel of those who have
had experience. It is only the pang of a day.
This kind of passion does not endure; but order
does. This is a passing fever of the fancy and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>blood. Be patient a little while, and it will cure
itself. Do not allow it to compromise your future.
You will be glad of having listened to me when
your love shall have died out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will never die!” he sobbed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will die!” she said. “And now, listen to
me. I have told the Sangredo that you are going
to visit them this afternoon. It is a week since
Bianca came home from school. You should have
gone sooner. Go, and make yourself agreeable.
If you do so, I will consent to your going once
more to see Professor Mora, and I will myself go
to inquire for him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man rose, and stood hesitating and
frowning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go, my dear!” his mother urged. “It is only
a civility, and commits you to nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He went slowly away, knowing well that further
appeal was useless. His mother followed him after
a moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My gondola!” she said to a servant who was
taking off the tablecloth, and went on to an adjoining
boudoir where her daughter sat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Boys are such a trial!” she said with an impatient
sigh, and dropped into a sofa. “Alfonso has,
happily, reached the age of reason. Enrico is
under good guardianship, or I should tremble for
his future, he is so impatient. It is true, Monsignor
Scalchi does live longer than we thought he
would; but, as I say to Enrico, can I kill Monsignor
Scalchi in order that you may be made a canon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>at once? Wait. He cannot live long. Enrico
declares that he will never die. And now Claudio,
with his folly!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What will he do?” the daughter asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will do as I command him!” the Marchesa
answered sharply. “I only wish, Isabella, that
you would be half as resolute with your son. Peppino
may go without his dessert this evening. It
may make him remember to rise the next time that
the mistress of the house leaves the table.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Scene II.</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>In a boarding-house, on the Riva degli Schiavoni,
a number of tourists, among them some artists,
are seated at their one o’clock dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Says a lady, “They say that the old Greek, or
Arabic, or Turkish, or Hindu, or Boston Professor
whom we met at the Lido last month—you
remember him, Mr. James?—well—where did I
begin? I’ve lost my nominative case.”</p>

<p class='c011'><em>2d Lady.</em> They say that he is dying, poor old
man! My gondolier told me this morning that Professor
Mora has visited every part of the globe,
and knows a thousand languages. He seemed
even to doubt if the professor might not have been
to the moon. The gondolier evidently looks upon
him with wonderment. And as for the professor’s
granddaughter, she is one of the marvels of the
earth.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>1st Lady.</em> Mr. James can tell you all about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>that. I think he did succeed in getting a sketch
of the girl, if not of her grandfather. I don’t
know where he keeps it, unless it is worn next his
heart. It is not among the sketches that he shows
to people. In fact, everything about this family
is mysterious and uncommon.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>A gentleman.</em> What is it, Mr. James? The
story promises to be interesting.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Mr. James (sotto voce).</em> Damn the women!
(<em>Aloud.</em>) This old professor, I am told, came
here fifteen years ago, some say, from the East.
Shortly after, his widowed daughter with her little
girl followed him. I am not aware that they behaved
in a mysterious manner, unless it is a mystery
that people should be able to live quietly and
innocently, and mind their own business; all which
the Mora certainly achieved. They were not rich,
but to the poor and unfortunate they were angels
of mercy.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>1st Lady (striking in).</em> Everybody didn’t
think so.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Mr. James.</em> Everybody doesn’t think that
God is good. Of course there were servants’ stories
and gossips’ stories, and those who wished to
believe them did believe them.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Gentleman.</em> Will the girl be left alone?</p>

<p class='c011'><em>1st Lady.</em> Do not cherish any hopes, sir. The
mother is dead; but the young lady has an admirer.
He is a fine young man with a palace and
an ancestry, and the most beautiful eyes in the
world. She goes out with him in his gondola by
moonlight. It is so romantic!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><em>Mr. James.</em> Did you ever see them out together
by moonlight, or at any other hour?</p>

<p class='c011'><em>1st Lady.</em> Others have.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Mr. James.</em> What others? Name one!</p>

<p class='c011'><em>1st Lady.</em> Really, sir! (<em>leaves the table</em>).</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Mr. James.</em> The Signorina Mora will not be
left alone. There is a respectable woman with
her—</p>

<p class='c011'><em>2d Lady.</em> A nurse!</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Mr. James.</em> —a very respectable woman with
her who has been here since her mother died, two
years ago. She is an elderly woman of very pleasant
appearance and manners. Some one has said
that she belongs to some charitable order that
nurses the sick.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>2d Lady (in a stage voice).</em> “Juliet! Where’s
the girl? What, Juliet!”</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Gentleman.</em> Ahem!</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Scene III.</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>In the church of Saint X. the half of the Chapter
on duty that week had just come out of choir,
and were taking off their vestments and laying
them away, each in his proper drawer in the wall
of the sacristy. The sound of alternate singing
and praying yet came from the church. A Novena
was going on; and Monsignor Scalchi, the
old <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">canonico</span></i> for whose place Monsignor Loredan
waited so impatiently, officiated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of the clergy hastened away, others lingered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>chatting together. One stood watching the
gloomy way in which Monsignor Loredan flicked a
speck of dust from his broad-brimmed hat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well?” said the young man, aware of the other’s
gaze, but without looking at him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was wondering how Monsignor Scalchi is,”
his friend said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When he sees me, he coughs,” said the coadjutor.</p>

<p class='c011'>At that moment the person of whom they spoke
entered the sacristy, with a priest at either hand.
A rustling cope of cloth of gold covered his whole
person, his eyes were downcast, his hands folded
palm to palm, and he murmured prayers as he
came.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young men stood respectfully aside as he
passed, his garments smelling of incense, and went
to disrobe at the other end of the sacristy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t lose courage, Don Enrico!” said one of
the group. “He looks feeble. He can scarcely
lift his feet from the floor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poh!” exclaimed Don Enrico. “He is as
strong as I am. He buys his shoes too long, so
that they may drag at the heels and make him
seem weak in the legs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He yawned, saluted with a graceful wave of the
hand, and sauntered out into the silent piazza.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don Enrico is out of temper about his brother’s
affairs, as well as his own,” one of his friends said
when he was out of hearing. “They say that
Claudio is in love with Tacita Mora, and is making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>a fool of himself. If he should offend the
Sangredo, Don Enrico will lose the cardinal’s
patronage. Professor Mora was as blind as a bat.
He thought that Tacita was a child, and that Don
Claudio was enamored of the Chinese language.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the nurse never leaves the girl,” some one
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! the nurse is dark!” said one of the sacristans.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes; they all agreed that the nurse was dark.</p>

<p class='c011'>One after another they dropped away, till only
Monsignor Scalchi was left kneeling at a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prie-dieu</span></i>,
and an under-sacristan going about his work, filling
a silver lamp for the shrine of Saint X., shaving
down the lower ends of great yellow wax torches to
set in triple-footed iron stands for a funeral, counting
out wafers for the altar. There was silence
save for a light lapse of water against the steps
outside; there was a sleepy yellow sunshine on
the marble floor, and a smell of incense in the soft
air.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Monsignor Scalchi rose from his knees, a
second under-sacristan entered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here are the books from San Lazzaro, Monsignore,”
he said. “But the translations from the
Turkish are not yet ready. The illness of Professor
Mora delayed them. He was to have looked
them over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you learn how the professor is?” asked the
prelate, glancing over the books given him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I went to ask, Monsignore. Gian says that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>is failing fast. The Marchesa Loredan has been
to see him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” exclaimed Monsignor Scalchi, looking
up from the volume in his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; and Gian says that the nurse watches
over everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The nurse seems to be a dark one,” monsignore
remarked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said the sacristan, “the nurse is dark.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Scene IV.</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The mistress of Palazzo Sangredo sat in one of
her stateliest salons talking with her cousin, the
Countess Bembo. At some distance from them,
half enveloped in the drapery of a great window,
Bianca Sangredo peeped out into the Canal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I saw him myself!” said the countess in a vehement
whisper. “I saw him go into the house, and
I saw him come out. And he was there again this
morning, and stopped half an hour. You ought to
have an explanation with the marchesa. Everybody
knows that the families wish for a marriage
between him and Bianca. If Sangredo would stay
at home and attend to his duties, Don Claudio
would not dare to behave so. But Sangredo never
is at home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, he is!” said Sangredo’s wife languidly.
“He is always at home in Paris. But
the marchesa declares that Claudio goes to Ca’ Mora
to study, and that he already speaks Arabic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>like a sheik. Professor Mora is famous. Papadopoli
says that since Mezzofanti no one else has
known so many languages.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said her cousin sharply. “And the professor’s
granddaughter will teach him to conjugate
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">amore</span></i> in every one of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mamma,” said Bianca from the window, “Don
Claudio’s gondola is at the step.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come and sit by me, child!” her mother said
hastily.</p>

<p class='c011'>When their visitor entered the salon, the two
elder ladies received him with the utmost cordiality.
Bianca only bent her head, and did not leave her
mother’s side; but her childlike dimpling smile
was full of kindness. She had a charming snow-drop
stillness and modesty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have already seen you to-day, Don Claudio,”
said the Countess Bembo. “I passed you near the
Giudecca; and you did not look at me, though our
gondolas almost touched.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg your pardon!” he said seriously. “I had
been, or was going, to the house of Professor Mora,
and I saw no one. He lies at the point of death.
It is a great grief to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The ladies began to question and sympathize.
After all, things might not be so bad as they had
feared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will be a loss to the world, as well as to his
friends,” Don Claudio said. “His knowledge of
languages is something wonderful. Besides that,
he is one of the best of men. His mode of teaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>caught the attention at once. ‘Sometimes,’
he once said to me, ‘you may see protruding from
the earth an ugly end of dry stick. Pull it, and
you find a long root attached. Follow the root,
and it may lead you to a beautiful plant laden with
blossoms. And so a seemingly dry and insignificant
fact may prove the key to a treasure of hidden
knowledge.’ That was his way of teaching.
However dry the proposition with which he began
a discourse, it was sure to lead to something interesting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must feel very sad!” the young girl said
compassionately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is sad,” he answered, and let his eyes dwell
on her fair, innocent face. Then, the entrance of
other visitors creating a little stir, he bent toward
her and murmured “Thanks!”</p>

</div>

<div>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was a still night, and all eastward-looking
Venice, above a certain height, was enameled as
with ivory by the light of a moon but little past its
full. Below, flickering reflections from the water
danced on the dark walls. The bending lines of
street lamps showed in dull golden blotches in that
radiant air. The same golden spots were visible
on gun-boat or steamship, and on a gondola
moored at the steps of Casa Mora.</p>

<p class='c011'>Above this waiting gondola a window stood wide
open to the night. It seemed to be the only open
window in Venice. All the others had their iron
shutters closed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seen from without, this open window was as
dark as the mouth of a cave. But inside, so penetrating
an effulgence filled the room, one might
have read the titles of the books in cases that lined
all the walls.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wide-open, curtainless window admitted a
square of moonlight so splendid as to seem tangible;
and in the midst of it, on a pallet, lay the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>professor, his face, hair, and beard almost as white
as the pillow they rested on. A slender girl knelt
at his right hand, her head bowed down. One
could see that her thick knot of hair was floss-fine
and gold-tinted, and her neck white and smooth.
At the opposite side of the couch a young man was
seated, bending toward it. In an arm-chair near
the foot, with her back to the light, sat a woman.
Her cheek resting on her hand, she gazed intently
at the dying man.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a prolonged silence he stirred, and
stretched a thin hand to touch the girl’s head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go and rest awhile, my Tacita!” he said. “I
will recall thee. Go, Elena. I will recall thee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The two rose at once and went out of the room,
hand in hand, closing the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I charge thee to let the girl alone!” Professor
Mora exclaimed the moment they were gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man started.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is no time for idle compliments,” the
other pursued with a certain vehemence. “I know
that thou hast taken a fancy to Tacita because she
is beautiful and good. She is of a tender nature,
and may have some leaning toward thee. I should
have been a more jealous guardian of both.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know that my mother has been here to-day,”
Don Claudio said bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thy mother is a worldly woman,” the old man
replied. “But in this she is right. Marry the
girl they have chosen for thee. It is not in thy
nature, boy, to be immovable and persistent in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>rebellion even against manifest injustice. Thy
protest would be the passion of a moment. They
would wear out thy courage and endurance. But
even with their consent, Tacita is not for thee. I
forbid it! Dost thou hear, Don Claudio Loredan?
I forbid it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You seemed to like me!” Don Claudio exclaimed
reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>The professor moved his hand toward the
speaker. “I love thee, Claudio. But that makes
no difference. He who would have Tacita must
live even as I have, without luxury or splendor,
striving to learn what human life means, and following
the best law that his soul knows.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man sighed. He had no such plan of
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will be a moment’s pain,” the other went on.
“But thy honor and her peace are at stake. I
charge thee”—he half rose in his earnestness—“I
charge thee to let the girl alone! Remember that
one day thou wilt have to lie as I lie here now,
all earthly passion burned to ashes, and only the
record of thy conscience to support, or cast thee
down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be tranquil!” said Don Claudio faintly, and
bowed his face into his hands. “I will obey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man sank back upon his pillow with a
murmured word of blessing, and looked out at the
violet sky. For a while he remained silent. Then
he spoke again, as if soliloquizing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The unfathomable universe! The baffling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>problem! Only the shades of night and of life
reveal something of the mystery to us. For eighty
years I have studied life from every side. I was
hungry to know. And the more I learned of any
subject the more clearly I perceived the vastness
of my own ignorance. I tried in vain to grasp the
plan of it all. I built up theories, fitting into them
the facts I knew. Sometimes the mosaic grew to
show a pattern; and then, just as I began to rejoice,
all became confusion again. I was Tantalus.
Again and again the universe held its solution
before my soul. Only a line more, and it was
mine! Yet it was forever snatched away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was silent a little while; then resumed: “In
one of those moments of disappointment I recollected
a text of the Hebrew Bible taught me in
my childhood: <em>The fear of the Lord is the beginning
of wisdom</em>. When I learned it, two paths
of life were opening out before my mind. One
was like a hidden rivulet, flowing ever in lowly
places, seeking ever the lowest place, refreshing,
beneficent. The other was like a mountain path,
and a star shone over it. I chose the mountain
path. It was often steep and hard, and the star
recedes as you climb. But the air on those heights
is sometimes an elixir. We had a song at home:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Sweet is the path that leads to what we love.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>How many a time I sang it to keep my courage up!</p>

<p class='c011'>“In that moment of recollection I asked myself
if I might not have more surely attained to what I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>sought by taking the lowlier way, if the supernatural
might not have aided material science, as imagination
aids in the mathematics. What means
the story of the tree of knowledge and the tree of
life? Many of those old tales contain a golden lesson.
We do not study the past enough; and therefore
human life becomes a series of beginnings
without visible results. There are a few centuries
of progress, something is learned, something
gained, a clearer light seems to announce the
dawn of some great day, and men begin to extol
themselves; and then a shadowy hand sweeps the
board clean, and the boasters disappear, they and
their achievements. Perhaps out of each fading
cycle God gathers up a few from destruction.
<em>Many are called, but few chosen</em>, said the King.
For the others the story of Sisyphus was told.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again there was a pause; and again he spoke:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was tossed hither and thither. I had such
failures that life seemed to me a mockery, and
such successes that I would fain have lived a thousand
years. Of one thing in it all I am glad: I
never complained of God in failure, nor glorified
myself in success. I give thanks for that!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He closed his eyes and seemed to pray.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a moment he spoke again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have known one perfect thing on earth,” he
said, and clasped his hands. “I have found in
life one beauty that grows on the soul forever.
One being in touching the earth has consecrated it.
There is no flaw in Jesus of Nazareth.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The pause that followed was so long that Don
Claudio bent to touch the cold hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dying man roused himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Farewell, my beloved pupil!” he said. “God
be with thee! Go in peace! And tell them to
come to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man knelt, and weeping, pressed his
lips to the cold hand that could not lift itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Farewell! God be with you!” he echoed in a
stifled voice; and rose and went out of the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>A light shone through the open door of an adjoining
chamber, and Tacita and the nurse could
be seen each lying on a sofa inside. They started
up at the sound of Don Claudio’s step.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He wants you,” the young man said, and
pressed the hand of each as they passed by him,
then went down to his gondola. A moment later
they heard the ripple of his passage across the
lagoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita knelt beside her grandfather and took his
hand in hers. He drew her, and she put her face
close to his.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dost thou remember all, my child?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I remember all!” she whispered back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou wilt be strong and faithful?” he asked
in the same tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will be strong and faithful,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>He said no more. His breath fluttered on her
cheek, and seemed to stop.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Elena!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>After bending for a moment over the bed, the
nurse had gone to the window, and stepped out into
the balcony. She returned at that frightened call,
and knelt by the bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the silence that followed, a gondola slipped
under the balcony; and presently there rose from it
a singing voice, low toned, but impassioned and
distinct. It sang:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“San Salvador, San Salvador,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>We cry to thee!</div>
      <div class='line in10'>Danger is in our path,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>The enemy, in wrath,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lurks to delude our souls from finding thee!</div>
      <div class='line in4'>We cry to thee! We cry to thee!</div>
      <div class='line in12'>San Salvador,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>We cry to thee!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The dying man, half sunk into a lethargy,
started awake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The mountains!” he exclaimed, looking eagerly
out at the dark outline of housetops against the
eastern sky. “The mountains and the bells!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He panted, listened, sighed at the silence, and
sank back again.</p>

<p class='c011'>The singer recommenced more softly; but every
word was so distinctly uttered that it seemed to be
spoken in the chamber:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“San Salvador, San Salvador,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>We turn to thee!</div>
      <div class='line in10'>All mercy as thou art,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>Forgive the erring heart</div>
      <div class='line'>That wandered far, but, weeping, homeward flies.</div>
      <div class='line in6'>We turn to thee! We turn to thee!</div>
      <div class='line in12'>San Salvador,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>We turn to thee.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“The mountains!” murmured the dying man.
“The curtain and the Throne!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the voice sang:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“San Salvador, San Salvador,</div>
      <div class='line in14'>We live in thee!</div>
      <div class='line in4'>’Tis love that holds the threads of fate;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Death’s but the opening of a gate,</div>
      <div class='line'>The parting of a mist that hides the skies.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>We live in thee! We live in thee!</div>
      <div class='line in14'>San Salvador,</div>
      <div class='line in14'>We live in thee!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There was one more sigh from the pillow. A
whisper came: “We live in Thee!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear,” said the nurse, laying her hand
softly on Tacita’s bowed head, “Professor Mora is
no longer an infirm old man.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Professor Mora was buried in the cemetery of
San Michele, with the rites of the Roman Church,
though he had not received the last sacraments.
That he had not, was supposed to have been the
fault of the nurse. It was known, however, that
he had made his Easter Communion; and those
who had seen him before the altar at San Giorgio
on that occasion spoke of his conduct as very edifying.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of them would doubtless have been puzzled,
and even scandalized, could they have read
his mind. That he was, in soul, prostrate at the
feet of his Creator, there could be no doubt. He
had often, of late years, spent an hour in some
church, kneeling, or sitting in deep thought. He
found it easier to recollect himself in the quiet of
such a place, surrounded by religious images.</p>

<p class='c011'>On this last Easter he had questioned:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall I confess my sins to a priest? Why
not? It can do me no harm, and it may do me
good. I will declare what I know of my own
wrong-doing, addressing God in the hearing of this
man. He uses many instruments. Perhaps the
forgiveness of God may be spoken to me by the
lips of this man. Shall I tell this man that I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>not know whether he has any authority, or not?
No. I am doing the best that I can; and his
claim that he has authority will have no weight
with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the same with his communion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it true that the Blessed Christ, the Son of
God, is mystically concentrated and hidden in the
wafer which will be placed upon my tongue, and
that he will pervade my being, as the souls of a
thousand roses are concentrated in a vial of attar,
and scent all the house with their sweetness? I do
not know. Nothing that God wills is impossible.
If I cry out to him, O my Father, I search, and
grope, and cannot find my Saviour! Send him,
therefore, to meet my soul in this wafer, that I
may live! At this point let me touch him, and
receive help, as the sick woman received it from
his garment’s hem!—he could meet me there, if it
were his will, and pour all heaven into my soul
through that channel. Does he will it? I do not
know. But since it is not impossible, I will bow
myself as if he were here. Is there a place where
God is not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was Professor Mora’s Easter Communion;
and many a formal communicant was less devout.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is true that he had bent in heathen temples
with an almost equal devotion; but it was always to
the same God.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Show me the path by which the instinct of worship
in any people, or individual, climbs to what
it can best conceive of the Divine,” he said, “and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>there I will find the footsteps of God coming to
meet that soul. A sunbeam falls on limpid water
and a lily, and they shine like jewels. The same
beam, turning, falls unshrinkingly on the muddy
pool, that brightens also after its manner, and as
well as it can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To him the Indian praying-wheel, so often denounced
as the height of material superstition,
might be made to indicate a fuller conception of
the infinity of God than was to be found in much
of the worship that calls itself intelligent and spiritual.
Written over and over on the parchment
wound about this wheel is the one brief prayer,
“O Jewel in the Lotos, Amen!” Their Divine
One was as the light of the morning embodied and
seated on a lotos-flower. Their prayer confesses
nothing and asks nothing; yet it confesses and
asks all. It is a dull longing in the dull, and a
lark song in the spiritual. It expresses their despair
of being able to tell his greatness, or their
need of him. It repeats itself as the flutterings of a
bird’s wings repeat themselves when it soars. The
soul says, “As many times as it is here inscribed,
multiplied by as many times as the wheel revolves
when I touch it, and yet a million times more, do
I praise thee, do I implore thee, do I love thee, O
thou Divine Light of the world! Even as the
planets whirl ceaselessly wrapped about in the
hieroglyphs of obedience to thy laws, so does this
wheel, encircled by the aspirations of our worship,
speak to thee for us.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>He entered one of their temples with respect, and
kneeling there, remembered what their Hindu
teachers had said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Owing to the greatness of the Deity, the One
Soul is lauded in many ways. The different Gods
are the members of the One Soul.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And also: “One cannot attain to the Divine Sun
through the word, through the mind, or through
the eye. It is only reached by him who says, ‘It
is! It is!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>As he meditated then with the door of his soul
wide open, it had seemed to him that all the gods
and all the worships of men had gathered themselves
before him, and mingled, as mists gather
into a cloud, and that from turbulent they had
grown still, and from dark they had gathered to
themselves light, growing more golden in the centre,
as though their divers elements were purifying
themselves to form some new unity, till the crude
and useless all melted away, parting to disclose an
infant seated on a lotos-flower, and shining like the
morning sun. And the lotos-flower was the figure
of a pure woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is! It is!” he had said then. And that
wide essential faith had survived, though for details
of dogma he had gone out of the world with
the same word with which he had begun his studies:
“I do not know!”</p>

<p class='c011'>A funeral gondola came and took his body away,
several gentlemen, Don Claudio among them, accompanying.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Tacita, wrapped in the window curtain, watched
them till the gondola disappeared under the Rialto
bridge, then threw herself, sobbing, into her companion’s
arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>The nurse persuaded her to seek some occupation.
“Come and help me make out the list of
books that Don Claudio is to have,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Professor Mora had given a large part of his
choice library to Don Claudio.</p>

<p class='c011'>This woman, Elena, had an interesting face.
There was something noble in the calm, direct look
of her eyes, and in her healthy matronly figure.
It would be difficult to describe her manners, except
by saying that there was nothing lacking, and
nothing superfluous.</p>

<p class='c011'>One sees occasionally a great lady whose character
is equal to her social position, who has that
manner without mannerism. A certain transparency
of action follows the outlines of the intention.
When this woman spoke, she had something to
say, not often anything brilliant, or profound, but
something which the moment required.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita at once busied herself with the list, and
found comfort in it. She needed comforting; for
she was of a tenderly loving nature, and her almost
cloistered life had confined her interests to
that home circle now quite broken up. Her father
had died in her infancy. Her mother, not much
older than herself, had been her constant companion,
friend and confidant. The loss of her had
been a crushing one; and the wound still bled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>But she and her grandfather had consoled each
other; and while he lived the mother had seemed
near. Now he, too, was gone!</p>

<p class='c011'>And there was yet another pain. Some little
tendrils of habit and affection had wound themselves
about her grandfather’s favorite pupil, and
they bled in the breaking. For they were to separate
at once. Nor had she any wish to remain in
Venice. She well knew that she would not be allowed
to see Don Claudio, except at her peril, and
that jealous eyes were already fixed upon them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet how slight, how innocent their intercourse
had been! She went over it all again in fancy as
she took down book after book.</p>

<p class='c011'>She and Don Claudio had always saluted each
other when he came; at first, with a ceremonious
bow, later, with a smile. They seldom spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>The table, piled with books, at which the professor
and his pupil sat, was placed before the lagoon
window, where, later, the old man’s deathbed
had been drawn. Her place was at a little
casement window on the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">rio</span></i> that ran beside the
house. They spoke in languages which she did
not understand, and she had often dropped her
work to listen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes, in going, his eyes had looked a wish
to linger; but she did not know how he had longed
to stay, nor how many glances had strayed from
the piles of books to her face. The graceful contours
of her form, her delicate whiteness, her
modesty, her violet eyes, the golden lights in her
hair—he had learned them all by heart.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Tacita. Yes,” he had thought, “that is the
right name for her. She stays there in that flickering
light and shade as silent as any lily!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Their world had been the world of a Claude
landscape, all floating in a golden haze.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once they had all gone out into the balcony to
watch a steamship from Cairo move up the lagoon
that was all radiant and red with the setting sun.
Another time a thunder-storm had darkened about
them, so that they could scarcely see each other,
and Don Claudio, coming to her table, had asked
softly,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you afraid, Tacita?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Another time he had brought her some roses
from his mother’s garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now, everything was ended!</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will come to-morrow for his books,” she
thought; “and, after that, we shall never see each
other again. But we shall be alone together once,
and speak a word of the past, and say farewell,
like friends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was all that she expected, or consciously
wished for, a friendly and sympathizing word, a
clasp of the hand, the first and the last, and a
“God be with you!” It would have sweetened
her sorrow and loneliness.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the visit of the Marchesa Loredan, Tacita’s
grandfather had talked with her; and the girl
had assured him that there was nothing between
her and Don Claudio but the calmest good-will.
Her naturally quiet disposition had not been disturbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>in his regard. But the thought that this
was to be their last meeting, and that for the first
time they would be alone, could not fail to agitate
her somewhat; and when morning came, her expectation
became a fluttering.</p>

<p class='c011'>The books were all sorted, the house all ready
for their departure. She and Elena would leave
Venice the next morning. She was alone in the
room where her grandfather had studied, taught,
and died.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a sound of oars that came nearer.
She listened, but would not look. “What can it
mean?” she thought. “There are double oars;
and he has but one gondolier.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Gian, the man-servant, entered and announced
the Marchesa Loredan and Don Claudio; and at
the same instant Elena slipped hastily into the
room, that her charge might not be found alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita’s heart sank heavily. She greeted her
visitors with an equal coldness, though Don Claudio’s
face implored her pardon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your books are all ready, Don Claudio,” she
said, when she could speak. “Professor Mora
said that you were to have those that are marked
with a white star. Gian will take them down.
Here is the list.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She gave him the paper, and he received it,
blushing with shame. He could not utter a word.
But the Marchesa’s voluble condolences and compliments
covered all defects in the conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was glad that the signorina was going to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>travel for a time. Nothing distracted one from
sorrow like traveling. Was there anything that
the Marchesa could do for her? She would send
her maid to the railway station the next morning
with a basket of luncheon for the travelers. If she
could help them in any other way, the signorina
might speak freely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita recollected the reply of Diogenes when
Alexander asked: “Is there anything that I can
do for you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only stand a little out of my sunshine,” said
Diogenes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Marchesa was most grateful for Professor
Mora’s gift to her son; and with the signorina’s approval,
Don Claudio proposed to erect a memorial
tablet in St. Michael’s to his honored preceptor.</p>

<p class='c011'>The proposal pleased and touched the desolate
girl, and she tearfully thanked Don Claudio.</p>

<p class='c011'>From her own point of view the Marchesa Loredan
had been very kind. Her visit would put
a stop to any serious gossip about her son and
Tacita; and she had shown a gracious regard and
respect for the dead <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</span></i> and his family.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had a very comfortable sense of having done
her duty, and been prudent in her own affairs at
the same time. That both Tacita and her grandfather
would have regarded such gossip with loathing
and contempt, and that they set no very high
value on her approval, she did not dream.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don Claudio should have been the one to tell
me this,” Tacita thought.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>The books were carried down, the laborious visit
came to an end, the orphan was alone again, her
sweet, sad hope crushed like a fragile flower.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Elena, take me away from here!” she exclaimed.
“No one has any heart. Take me
away!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t cry, dear! We will go in the morning,”
her friend said soothingly. “Don Claudio
will come to take leave of you at the station. He
found a chance to tell me so. He said that he
could not get away alone this morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is cruel, and he is weak,” said Tacita. “I
like not a weak man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena shook her head. “Ah! my dear, a man
is usually weak before a strong-willed woman who
loves herself better than she does him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Claudio was, in fact, waiting at the station
when they arrived there the next morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could not let you go without a word,” he said
in an agitated murmur. “I shall always remember,
and regret. Oh! the sweet old days! Tacita,
do not you see that my heart is breaking?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear friend,” she answered gently, “we will
remember each other with a tender friendship.
Your heart will not break. It must not. A loving
wife will console you. <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Addio!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To God!” There could be no more perfect
parting word. They clasped hands for one trembling
moment, then bowed their heads, and turned
away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Among those who were on the steps of San Michele
when the funeral gondola of Professor Mora
reached them was a man who seemed to be waiting
to assist at his burial. He followed to the chapel,
and went away as soon as the service was over.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a young man, scarcely more than thirty
years of age, a little taller than medium, slender,
but athletic, and of a dark complexion. In the
light, his dark hair had an auburn tinge, and his
dark eyes a violet shade. His fine serious face had
a look of high intelligence, and in the church,
something even exalted, in its expression. He had
brows to which Lavater would have ascribed great
powers of observation; and his look was steady and
penetrating. It recalled the old story of disguised
deities who were recognized by their moveless eyeballs.
He was quiet, and his dress was conventional,
neither fine nor coarse. Both face and manner
expressed refinement. It could be seen that his
hands bore the marks of labor. If you had asked
what his trade was, he would have said that he was
a carpenter. Those who looked at him once with
any attention, looked again.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the funeral was over, this young man
crossed the Laguna Morta, and landed at the steps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>behind San Marco. He went round into the
church, looking at every part of it attentively.
He did not appear to be either an artist or a worshiper,
still less a tourist.</p>

<p class='c011'>He might have been taken for an artisan who
examined intelligently, but without enthusiasm, to
see how the work was done. A closer view of his
luminous dark eyes revealed a second expression,
something mystical and exalted, as though he looked
through the object his glance touched, and saw,
not only the workman who had wrought it, but his
mind and intention.</p>

<p class='c011'>He made one slow circuit of the church, uttering
not a word till he went up stairs and looked at the
Judas hanging to a tree, the fresco half hidden in
a corner of the gallery.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Absit!</span></i>” he exclaimed then, shuddering.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he went out of the church, an old man seated
on the step tried to rise, but with difficulty, being
lame. The stranger aided him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You suffer,” he said kindly. “Are you very
poor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not suffer much,” the old man replied in a
cheerful tone. “But my joints are stiff. And I
am not poor. I have a son who earns good wages,
thank God!”</p>

<p class='c011'>A sweet smile lighted for an instant the stranger’s
face. “Addio, brother!” he said, and went
on, out through the piazzetta, and down the Riva
degli Schiavoni.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">rio</span></i> along which stretched a garden, several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>boys were engaged with some object around
which they were crouched on the pavement. It
proved to be a little green lizard which they had
caught on the garden wall. They were trying to
harness it to a bunch of leaves. The little thing
lay on its back, gasping.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stranger, with a quick, fiery movement,
pushed the boys aside, and released their captive.
He took the nearly dead creature in his hand, and
carried it to the garden wall, then returned to the
boys, who had been surprised into a temporary
quiescence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Boys,” he said, “when some strong, cruel person
shall make you suffer for his amusement, remember
that lizard. If you should some day be
helpless and terrified and parched with thirst, remember
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He left them speechlessly staring at him, called
a gondola, and gave the direction of the railway
station. As he passed Ca’ Mora, he looked earnestly
at the window over the balcony. Elena
stepped out and saw him. He raised his hand
above his face in salutation, and she replied, raising
her hand in the same way.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he reached the railway landing, two gondoliers
were standing on the steps, confronting each
other in loud and angry dispute. They gesticulated,
and flung profane and furious epithets at
each other.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stranger paused near them, and looked at
one of the disputants with a steady gaze that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>seemed presently to check his volubility. The
man grew uneasy, his attention was divided, he
faltered in some retort, then turned abruptly away
from his still menacing antagonist, and began to
fumble with the oars and <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">felse</span></i> of his gondola.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stranger went into the station and bought
his ticket. As he stood waiting, the gondolier he
had observed came in and accosted him respectfully,
and with some embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose you thought I was behaving badly,
signore,” he said. “But Piero has got three passengers
away from me to-day, and I couldn’t stand
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not condemned you, friend,” said the
stranger mildly. “What does your own judgment
say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man’s eyes fell. “I needn’t have used
certain words,” he said in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your judgment decides well,” said the stranger.
“It has no need of my interference. Addio, Gianbattista
Feroli.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Addio!” the gondolier echoed dreamily, and
stood looking after him. “He has a saint’s face,”
he muttered. “But how did he know my name!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>On leaving Venice, Tacita Mora’s ultimate destination
was to go to her mother’s relatives, after
some months spent in travel. Elena was to be her
companion and guardian on the journey.</p>

<p class='c011'>Who her mother’s relatives were, and where they
were, she did not know. She had once asked her
mother, who replied,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“My child, it is better, for many reasons, that
you should not know till you see them. They are
quiet, respectable people. You have nothing to
disturb your mind about on their account. They
know of you. They will keep track of you, and
seek you at the proper time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, as I do not wish others, who would be unfriendly,
should know of them, it is better that you
should remain ignorant for the present. People
may ask you questions, and you will thus be spared
the trouble of evading, or refusing to answer.
Confide in no one. Absolutely, confide in no one,
as you value your life! The person who displays
curiosity concerning your private affairs is the very
last person whom you should trust. Curiosity is
a tattler, or an insinuator. Do not talk of your
personal affairs outside of your own family. I
will give you a sign by which my people are to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>recognized. You are never to give that to any
one, even to them, nor to intimate that you know
such a sign. They will give it to you, anywhere,
if there should be need. If no trouble should occur,
it will be given you by the side of a rock. To
such a person you may trust everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This conversation had taken place on their last
visit to the Lido, as they walked on the sands,
picking up shells, and dropping them again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Professor Mora had given his granddaughter the
same charge, adding,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some one may solicit you artfully, suspecting a
secret, and pretending to know it. Beware of the
curious. For your life, remain firm and silent!
And now, forget it all till the time shall come to
remember. Do not let your imagination dwell
upon the subject.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was with this prospect that the orphan set out
on her travels.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never was there a better companion than hers
proved to be. The nurse had traveled extensively,
and was guardian, friend, and courier in one. She
had all the firmness and courage that a man could
have, with the more ingratiating ways of a woman.
And she was an intelligent guide.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita was to remain under this woman’s protection
till her friends should claim her. She would
then place herself entirely under their guardianship,
and remain with them, if contented, five
years. If she should desire to leave them before
that time should expire, they were to find a retreat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>for her. Her fortune was invested, and the
income regularly paid; but how it was placed she
did not ask. She only knew to whom she was to
look for money, and to whom she was to appeal in
case of accident. These persons were rather numerous,
and were scattered over the greater part of
Europe. None were of any special distinction, and
none were bankers. There was a musician of repute
among them, and a public singer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena was also to join friends of her own whom
she had not seen for years, when she should have
placed her charge in safety. Who and where these
friends were, Tacita took good care not to inquire.
They were people who lived in a small mountain
city, Elena volunteered to tell her. “And perhaps,
dear, you might like to go there with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would go anywhere with you!” Tacita said
warmly. “I do not dare to think of a time when
I must lose you. I will not anticipate trouble;
but when we have to part, you may be sure that I
shall insist on an appointment for a meeting not
far distant in time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Traveling was a delight to Tacita. She had all
that curiosity to see the world that a child has to
whom the world is fairyland. The names of some
places were to her like roses, or music, or like rolling
thunder. She had read of them in prose and
song. When she looked at them, in their possibly
unimpressive features, she still found traces of
their story, like the furrows left in a face by some
tragical experience.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Oh, the waterfalls!” she exclaimed, as their
train rolled through the Alps. “So white above,
so green and white below! Where can I have seen
a white scarf like that wavering down from a
height! Perhaps I passed this way with my
mother when first we came to Venice. It is such
a fresh wild place!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She stood to look down at the torrent foaming
among gray rocks below; then leaned back on the
cushions, and fixed her eyes on the snow-peaks that
seemed almost in the zenith.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I remember so much that my grandfather used
to say, though I seemed often to listen carelessly,”
she said. “He sometimes made such an odd impression
on my mind. It might be he would talk
half to me and half to himself, as if thinking
aloud. He would seem to open the door of a subject,
look in curiously, find it unpromising, and
come out again. Or he would brighten as if he
had found a treasure, and go on talking beautifully.
When some astronomer had discovered a new star,
he said the Te Deum should be sung in the
churches, and he gave an alms and kept a lamp
burning all night in honor of it, and we had ices in
the evening. And before we separated to go to
our rooms, he read the Gloria, and said three
times over the sentence, ‘We give thee thanks for
thy great glory.’ Listening to him, I sometimes
felt as though people’s minds were, for the greater
part, like the tossing waves of a stormy sea. He
said once of a crowd, ‘They do not think; some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>one has set them swinging. I wonder what sets
them all swinging! There is God, of course.
But what instrument does he use? The stress of
circumstance? Or is the tidal wave that gives the
impulse some human mind fully alive?’ I think
the human mind was his idea. He said that some
people were cooled off and crusted over like planets,
and others all alive, like suns. He used to
speak of reflective men and light-giving men. He
was light-giving.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They visited Germany and the North, France,
Great Britain, Spain and Algiers; and Tacita was
getting very tired, though she did not say so.
Elena had acquaintances in all those countries, and
appeared to have errands in some. A year passed.
It was spring again when they reached Seville from
Africa, saw the Holy Week processions, and laid
in a store of fans, silver filigree buttons, sashes,
and photographs. Already a large number of
boxes had been sent “home” from the different
countries they had seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The evening before setting out from Seville to
Madrid, Elena, for the first time, asked Tacita
concerning her mother’s relatives.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you do not know them, nor where they are,”
she said, “how can you communicate with them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Both my mother and grandfather told me to
give myself no uneasiness,” Tacita replied. “I
thought that it was all settled with you. We are
soon to visit your home. After that, they will probably
come, or send for me. Are you impatient?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“Certainly not, my dear! I would most willingly
keep you always with me. But you have
money, and some dishonest person might attempt
to deceive you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! I have no fear,” said Tacita with a reserve
that savored of coldness. She was surprised
that the subject had been introduced, and astonished
at her companion’s persistence. It seemed
to have been avoided by mutual consent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me how you will know them, and we will
seek them together,” said Elena.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not to seek them,” said Tacita with decided
coolness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there, then, a secret?” asked her companion,
with playful mockery.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita looked at her steadily, and grew pale.
“I thought that I knew you; and I do not,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena resumed her dignity. “If you really object
to telling me, then I will not ask,” she said.
“You had not mentioned the fact that it was a
great secret.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor have I said so now,” answered the girl
with a look of distress. “My mother talked with
me of our affairs just before she died, and my
grandfather gave me some directions. What they
said to me is sacred, and is mine. I do not wish to
talk of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You swear that you will not tell me?” said
Elena, looking at her keenly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will not swear to anything!” exclaimed Tacita.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“And I request you not to mention the subject
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will then dismiss it,” said her companion,
and rose to leave the room. “I presumed on what
I thought was a confidential friendship, and on the
fact that your family confided you to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita said nothing. Her head drooped. All
her past sorrows seemed to return upon her. This
woman, heretofore so dignified and so delicate, had
appeared to her in a new light. She had sometimes
fancied that Elena understood something of
her affairs; but, apparently, she did not. That
she should show a vulgar and persistent curiosity
was shocking.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a while Elena came into the room, and
standing at a window, looked out into the purple
twilight starred with lamps. The crowd that in
Seville seems never to sleep was flowing and murmuring
through the plaza and the streets.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita was weeping silently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear child!” exclaimed the woman, going
to embrace her. “Are we not friends?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You made me fear that we were not,” said
Tacita.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dismiss that fear! I will never so offend you
again.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>One morning shortly after their arrival at Madrid,
the two went to the great picture-gallery, of
all picture-galleries the most delightful.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When you shall have seen Murillo’s Conceptions,”
Elena said, “you will see the difference between
a sweet human nature and a supernatural
creature. Raphael has painted good and beautiful
women full of religious feeling; Murillo has
painted the miraculous woman. The Spaniard had
a vision of the Divine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have been in Madrid before?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For two years,” said Elena quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'>They entered the large hall. It was early for
visitors; but two artists were there copying. One
had had the courage to set his easel up before one
of Murillo’s large Conceptions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita seated herself before that heavenly vision,
and became absorbed in it. It was a revelation to
her. The small picture in the Louvre had made
but a slight impression on her, weary as she was
with sight-seeing. But here was a reflection of
heaven itself in the exquisite figure that floated before
her supported on a wreath of angels, the white
robe falling about her in veiling folds, and the long
cerulean scarf full of that same wind that shook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>the house wherein waited the Apostles and the
Marys when the Holy Ghost descended upon them.
The two little hands were pressed palm to palm,
the long black hair fell down her shoulders, her
large black eyes, fixed on some dawning, ineffable
glory, were full of a solemn radiance, her delicate
face was like a white lily in the sunshine. The
figure was at once childlike, angelic, and imposing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita had not removed her eyes from the picture
when Elena came to touch her arm, and whispered:
“Do you know that you have not winked
for half an hour?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita roused herself. “I scarcely care to look
at anything else now,” she said. “I will glance
about the room there, and then go home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She went into the Isabella room, and walked
slowly along the wall. Nothing dazzled her after
that Murillo. Even Fra Angelico’s angels looked
insipidly sweet beside its ethereal sublimity. The
“Perla” kept her but a moment. Those radiant
black eyes of the “Concepcion” seemed to gaze at
her from every canvas. She was about leaving the
room, when something made her turn back to look
again at an unremarkable picture catalogued as “A
Madonna and Saints.” Of the two catalogues she
saw, one ascribed it to Pordenone, the other to
Giorgione. She glanced at it without interest,
wondering why she had stopped. The Madonna
and Child, and the woman who held out to them a
basket of red and white roses might just as well not
have been painted for any significance they had;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and she was about turning away when she caught
sight of a face in the shadowed corner of the canvas
behind the kneeling woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was no conventional saint. The man
seemed to be dressed in armor, and his hand rested
on a sword-hilt or the back of a chair. The shadows
swathed him thickly, leaving the face alone
distinct. One guessed at a slight and well-knit
figure. The face was bronzed, and rather thin, the
features as delicate as they could be without weakness.
Dark auburn hair fell almost to the shoulders,
a slight moustache shaded the lip, a small
pointed beard the chin. The brows were prominent,
and strong enough to redeem a weak face,
even; and beneath them were the eyes that go with
such brows, penetrating, steady, far-seeing, and
deep-seeing. Those eyes were fixed on the Madonna
and Child, not in adoration, but with an earnest
attention. He stood erect, and seemed to be
studying the characters of those two beings whom
the woman before him knelt to worship. Yet,
reserved and incisive as the look was, something
of sweetness might be discerned in the man’s
face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita, half turned to go away, remained gazing
at that face, fascinated. What a fine strength and
purity! What reserve and what firmness! It
was a face that could flash like a storm-cloud.
Would anything ever make such a man fear, or
be weak, careless, or cruel?</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena came and stood by her, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“Behold a man,” said Tacita, “whom I would
follow through the world, and out of the world!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her companion did not speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why was I not in the world when he lived in
it!” the girl went on. “Or why is he not here now!
Fancy that face smiling approval of you! Elena,
do the dead hear us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The living hear us!” replied the woman. “Is
the air dead because you cannot see it? Is it powerless
because it is sometimes still? It is only the
ignoble who go downward, and become as stones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She spoke calmly and with a sort of authority.</p>

<p class='c011'>They went out together.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are late for our luncheon,” Elena said as
they got into their carriage. “We must lose no
time, if we are to see the king and queen go out
to drive. Are you decided to leave Madrid to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know,” Tacita replied absently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall want to know this evening, dear; so try
to make up your mind. I want to send for some
of my people to meet us. I hope that you will like
my people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If they are like you, I shall love them,” Tacita
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How long will you be content to stay with us?”
the woman asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How can I say, Elena? You have told me
that your people are quiet, kind, and unpretending.
That is pleasant, but only that is not enough for a
long time. I want to see persons who know more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>than I do, who can paint, play on instruments,
dance, sing, model, write poetry, speak with eloquence,
and govern with strength and justice. I
think that my heart would turn to lead if I had
to live forever with people who were uncultivated.
But if your people are like you, they are not
merely simple. You know a great deal more than
I do; and you are always <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">simpatica</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By simplicity, I do not mean ignorance,” her
friend said. “Professor Mora was simple. Some
barbarous persons are very involved and obscure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! if you speak in that sense”—</p>

<p class='c011'>They ate their luncheon, stepped into the carriage
that was waiting for them, and drove to the
Plaza del Oriente. A good many persons were
standing about the streets there waiting to see the
young king and queen, Alfonso and Cristina, drive
out. It was a gathering of leisurely, serious-looking
people, with very few among them showing
signs of poverty. The sky was limpid above the
trees; and in the square opposite the corner at
which our travelers waited, a bronze horseman
seemed leaping into the blue over their topmost
boughs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita glanced about her, at the people, the palace
gate from which the royal cortége would issue,
at the bronze horseman in the air; and then, turning
a little to the other side, saw a man leaning
carelessly against the trunk of a tree—saw him,
and nothing else.</p>

<p class='c011'>She felt as though she had received an electric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>shock. There before her was the face of the Giorgione
picture, every feature as she had studied it
that morning, and the very expression of which she
had felt the power. He was gazing at the palace
gate, not as though waiting to see, but already seeing.
One would have said that the walls were
transparent to him, and that he was so absorbed in
observing that king and queen whom no one else
saw as to be oblivious to all about him.</p>

<p class='c011'>His dress was some provincial or foreign costume.
Black velvet short-clothes were held at the
waist by a fringed scarf of black silk. His short
jacket of black cloth was like a torero’s in shape.
He wore a full white shirt, black stockings and
sandals, and a scarlet fez on his dark hair in which
the sunshine found an auburn tint.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita gazed at him with eyes as intent as his
own. The smileless lips, the brow with its second
sight, the pointed beard and faintly bronzed skin—they
were the same that she had but an hour or
two before engraven on her mind in lines as clear
and sharp as those of any antique intaglio.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stranger had not seemed aware of her observation;
and the distance at which he stood from
her gave no reason for his being so. But presently,
when she began to wonder if he would ever
stir, he went quietly to a poor woman who, with a
child in her arms, leaned against the fence behind
him, and took the child from her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked surprised, but yielded in silence.
The infant stared at him, but made no resistance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>He had not looked directly at either of them, nor
addressed them. He brought the child to the carriage,
and held it out, his eyes lowered, not downcast,
nor once looking at its occupants.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both Tacita and Elena silently placed a silver
coin in the child’s hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man retreated a step, respectful, but not
saluting, and carried the child to its mother. She
showed in receiving it the same silent surprise with
which she had yielded it to him. The stranger returned
to his former position under the tree. He
had not looked at any one, nor spoken a word; yet
he had displayed neither affectation nor rudeness.
A winged seed could not have floated past with
more simplicity of action, nor yet with more grace.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a stir among the people. Two horsemen
had issued from the palace gate, and an open
carriage followed, behind which were again two
other cavaliers. Tacita descended hastily from the
carriage. In doing so she glanced at the tree
against which the stranger had leaned; but he was
no longer to be seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The royal carriage passed by, its occupants bowing
courteously to the young traveler who courtesied
from her post on the sidewalk. The queen was
pale and sad-looking, the spirited face of the young
king had something in its expression that was almost
defiant. The spectators were cold and merely
civil. At such a sight one remembers that kings
and queens have also hearts that may be wounded,
and that they sometimes need and deserve compassion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Few of them, indeed, have willfully grasped
the crown; and on many of them it has descended
like a crown of thorns.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The king gives the queen the right hand,
though she is queen consort only,” Tacita said as
they drove away. “In Italy the king regnant must
absolutely have the right; and etiquette is quite as
imperative in placing the gentleman at the lady’s
left hand. Consequently, the king and queen of
Italy do not drive out together. Gallantry yields
to law, but evades a rudeness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was scarcely conscious of what she was saying.
Her eyes were searching the street and
square. “What is his name?” she exclaimed suddenly,
without any preface whatever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His name is Dylar,” answered Elena. “He
will make a part of the journey with us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is from your place?” Tacita asked. She
could not have told whether she felt a sudden joy
or a sudden disenchantment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he is from our place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The child was not his?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why did he bring it to us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Probably he saw that they were poor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does he know them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He must know that they are poor, or he would
not have asked charity for them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He asked nothing,” said Tacita.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet you gave.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is true; he did ask and seemed sure of receiving.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Why does he make a part of the journey
with us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He knows the way and the people. He will
meet us when we cross the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder if they are the mountains that my
grandfather remembered!” thought Tacita, and
asked no more. Some feeling that was scarcely
fear, but rather a sense of coming fate, began to
creep over her. She had entered upon a path
from which there was no retreat, and something
mysterious was stealing about her and closing
her in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dylar is here,” Elena said as they drove into
the gardens of the Ritiro. “Shall we stop and
speak to him? I want to tell him when we will
leave Madrid. What shall I say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will leave to-morrow morning,” Tacita
said, looking eagerly around. Already it seemed
to her a wonderful thing to hear this man speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was walking to and fro under the trees, and
came to the side of their carriage immediately.
He glanced at Tacita, and slowly bowed himself in
something of an oriental fashion. One might have
hesitated whether to compare his manner to that of
a perfectly trained servant come to take orders, or
to the confident reserve of a sovereign about to hear
if his orders had been obeyed. “The signorina
has decided to set out to-morrow morning,” Elena
said to him. “We shall not stop anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will meet you at the orange-farm,” the man
answered quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The voice was clear and low, the enunciation
perfect.</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked at Tacita with a reassuring kindness.
“Elena knows all that is necessary,” he said.
“Trust to her, and have no fear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She felt herself in the presence of a superior.
“I have no fear now,” she replied; and thought,
“How did he know that I was afraid!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He drew back, and they went on their way,
neither speaking of what had occurred.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Tacita resumed her journey in a dream, and
pursued it in a dream. She asked no questions,
and observed but little, though at times it seemed
to her that the line of their progress was a zigzag.
Did they cross the water a second time? Why did
they travel so much by night, and sleep by day?
She did not care. Her mind became dimly aware
of these questions rather than asked them. Had
she taken hashish? No matter. All that she
wanted was rest. Her very eyelashes and fingernails
were weary. Oh, for the mountains, for a
place to call home, and rest!</p>

<p class='c011'>She received the impression that a part of the
country through which they passed was like a
burnt-out world, all sand and black rocks, so that
the limpid rivulet that met them somewhere was a
surprise. She wondered languidly that it was not
dried up. Was it a week, or a month, since Dylar
had said, “Have no fear”? No matter. She had
no fear; but she was, oh, so weary! Fortunately,
nothing was required of her but passive endurance
of fatigue. She was borne along, and tenderly
cared for.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day she roused herself a little, or something
was done to rouse her. They were in an easy old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>carriage drawn by mules. It had met them at a
solitary little station of which she had not seen nor
asked the name; and they had been driving through
a dry plain, and were now in pine woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena gave her some little cakes of chocolate and
slices of lemon. “We are almost out of provisions,”
she said; “but in an hour you shall have
a good dinner; and then to bed with her, like a
sleepy child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena was smiling brightly. Tacita gave a languid
smile in return, and leaned back, looking out
the window. The pines had ceased, and there was
a rice-field at one side, and orange-trees heavily
laden with ripe fruit at the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>The oranges reminded her of Naples, which she
had visited when a child. The blue bay and blue
sky seemed to sparkle before her, the songs bubbled
up, there was the soft splendor of profuse flowers,
the fruits, the joy in life, the careless gayety;
and, crowning these delights, that ever-present
menace smoking up against the sky, telling of boiling
rivers from a boiling pit of inextinguishable
fire ever ready to overflow, bearing destruction to
all that beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The utmost of earthly delight has ever its
throne on the edge of a crater,” she thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>The orange-trees pressed closer, right and left,
there were blossoms with the fruit, and the western
sun shone through both. The air was fresh
and sweet. She saw nothing but glossy foliage and
golden balls, and a green turf strown with gold.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“It is Andalusia, or the Hesperides!” she said,
waking, and sitting up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even as she spoke, the green and gold wall came
to an end, and at a little distance a whitewashed
stone house was visible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look!” exclaimed Elena; and leaning toward
her, pointed upward out of the carriage window.</p>

<p class='c011'>Behind the house, showing over its roof like a
crown on a head, was a curve of olive-trees on a
hill-top. Above the trees rose wild rocks in fantastic
peaks and precipices, and above the rocks,
closely serrated, was a range of Alp-like mountains
upholding a mass of snow and ice that glittered
rosily in the sunset.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it your home?” asked Tacita eagerly. “How
beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not yet,” her friend answered, her eyes, filled
with tears of joy, fixed on those shining heights.
“But from my home those mountains are visible.
To-morrow night I shall sleep under my own blessed
roof!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The door of the house stood open, but no one
appeared in it. At some distance were several
persons, men and women, gathering oranges. They
paused to look at the travelers, but made no movement
to approach them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We do not need any one,” Elena said. “You
shall go directly to your chamber; and after supper
you shall sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They entered a vestibule from which a stair ascended.
The inner doors were closed. They went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>up to a pleasant chamber that looked toward the
mountains and the south. At their left, toward
the east, twilight had already come under the
shadow of those heights and the pines beneath.
But shafts of red gold still shot over their heads
from the west, and all the shadows had a tinge of
gold. An orange-tree that grew beneath their window
lifted a crowded cluster of ripe fruit above the
sill, as if offering it to the travelers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you!” Tacita said, and detached one
from the bunch where they grew so close that each
one had a facet on its side.</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena, who seemed to feel perfectly at home, left
her resting and went down stairs for their supper.
She had made no mistake in saying that it would
be a good supper. An hour later, the shadows
had lost their gold, and Tacita was asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>How sweet is the deep sleep of weariness that
hopes and trusts! It is not alone that every nerve
and muscle lets slip a burden, that the heart gives
a thankful sigh, and the busy brain grows quiet.
The pleasure is more than negative. Such sleep
comes as the tide comes in calm weather. Transparent,
yet tangible, it steals over the tired senses,
its crest a whispered lullaby. Deeper, then, smoothing
out the creases of life with a down-like touch.
Yet deeper, and a full swell submerges the consciousness,
and you lie quiescent at the bottom of
an enchanted sea.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Are you prepared for mountain climbing?”
Elena asked the next morning when Tacita woke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am prepared for anything! I have had such
a refreshing sleep! How long has it been?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nearly twelve hours, my dear. Your ancestors
must have come from Ephesus. I thought that I
knew how to sleep; but the singleness of purpose
with which you lay yourself away is something entirely
your own. It is a gift. It arrives at genius.
Now, who do you think that I can see coming over
a rocky path above the olives?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can it be Dylar?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is Dylar. He will be here in fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The people of the house paid as little attention
to their guests in the morning as they had the
evening before. Elena brought the breakfast,
if she did not prepare it. Probably they were
all out picking oranges. Children were visible
at a distance gathering the fruit up from under
the trees. The orchard was a good many acres in
extent.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Tacita, prepared for her journey, went
down to the door, their driver of the day before
stood there with two donkeys girded with chair-shaped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>saddles, with high backs and foot-rests.
Not far away there was another donkey. Beside
it stood a man who uncovered his head, and looked
with an eager smile at the young traveler when she
appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is one of my people,” Elena said. “I have
been talking with him. You should salute him in
this way,” lifting her hand above her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita imitated her with a smiling glance toward
the guide, who responded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Away under the trees talking with the farmers
was a third man, who as soon as Tacita appeared,
came to meet her.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Dylar; but Dylar in a conventional dress
such as any gentleman might wear in traveling; and
with the dress, he had assumed something of the
conventional manner. Had he lost by the change?
she asked herself, while he made courteous inquiries,
and looked to see if her saddle was firm. No:
the face was the same, and could easily make one
forget the costume; and there was sincerity in the
tone of his inquiries.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We cross this angle of the mountains, and go
back almost in the direction from which you came
yesterday,” Dylar said. “I am sorry that it was
necessary to take you by the longer way. Late in
the afternoon we shall reach a house where you
and Elena will sleep. It is a solitary place, but
more comfortable than it looks at first sight, and
it is quite safe. To-morrow you will have but
three hours’ ride.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>They mounted, and took the path that led backward
over the heights. They rode singly, Elena
with her guide leading. Tacita followed with a
man at her bridle, and Dylar came last.</p>

<p class='c011'>The air grew cooler and finer. It was the air
that makes one wish to dance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita asked herself what it could be in all these
faces,—Dylar’s, Elena’s, the two guides’, yes,
and in her own mother’s and grandfather’s,—which
made them resemble each other in spite of
different features and characters. It was a spiritual
family resemblance. Ingenuous was not the
word. It was not dignity alone. Strong and gentle
did not describe it. It was the expression of a
certain harmonious poise and elastic firmness of
mind indicating that each one had found his
proper place, and was content with it; indicating,
too, a mutual complaisance, but a supreme dependence
on something higher.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their way led deeper into the mountains. Now
and then, in turnings of the path, Tacita lost sight
of her companions. She looked backward once for
Dylar. When he appeared, he smiled and waved
his hand to her encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He smiled!” she whispered to herself, but did
not look back again.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sky was blue and cloudless, and pulsed with
its fullness of light. Somewhere, not far away,
there was a waterfall. Its infant thunder and lisping
splash pervaded the air. The scene grew more
grand and terrible. One moment they would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>shut into a narrow space from which exit seemed
impossible, dark stone grinding close without a
sign of pathway; then the solid walls were cleft as
in an instant. In the near deeps lurked a delicate
shadow; far below was revealed from time to time
a velvety darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita’s mind, floating between present contentment,
a half-forgotten pain, and a mystical anticipation,
confused the scene about her with others
far away. Clustered windows, crowded sculptures
and balconies, seemed to emboss the cliffs at either
hand, or float in misty lines along their surfaces.
The sound of the haunting cascade became the dip
of oars, or the swash of the lagoon ploughed by a
steamboat. She saw their time-stained old Venetian
house; and the last scenes she had witnessed
there rose before her. A wreath of mist that had
risen from some invisible stream and paused among
the rocks recalled a narrow bed with a white-haired
old man lying on it, peaceful and dead.
The hymn sung as he died seemed only that moment
to have ceased on the air. Why had it
sounded familiar? Perhaps it might have a phrase
in common with some song she knew. How did it
go? She hummed softly, feeling for the tune,
found a bar or two, and sang in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>To her astonishment, her guide at once took up
the strain, and from him Elena and her guide, and
then Dylar. They sang:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“San Salvador, San Salvador,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>We live in thee!</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>’Tis love that holds the threads of fate;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Death’s but the opening of a gate,</div>
      <div class='line'>The parting of a mist that dims the sky.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>We live in thee! We live in thee!</div>
      <div class='line in12'>San Salvador,</div>
      <div class='line in12'>We live in thee!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Tacita held her breath to listen. Was she indeed
riding through mountain paths and morning
air, or lying in a dream in some strange land?
Dylar’s was the voice that had sung beneath their
window when her grandfather was dying!</p>

<p class='c011'>The way grew wilder. The rocks were black
and frowning. Sometimes their path was but a narrow
shelf along the face of a precipice. Once the
guide made her descend, and fastened a rope from
iron hook to hook set in the rock for her to hold in
passing.</p>

<p class='c011'>At noon they reached a little plateau,—a few
feet of short turf, some tiny vines and spotted
lichens, and a blue flower, all of which seemed miracles
in that place. Here they dismounted and ate
their luncheon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a wonder a flower would be, if there were
only one in the world!” Dylar said, seeing Tacita
bend over this.</p>

<p class='c011'>She smiled, and continued to examine it carefully,
without touching. It seemed something sacred.
Who drew the little lines on its petals, and
scattered the gold dust in its heart, and gave it all
that seeming of innocent faith and courage? The
grass-blades, too, with their fine serrated edges,
and sharp points thrust upward, then curving over,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>as if they were spears changing to pruning-hooks,—what
beautiful things they were when there were
but few!</p>

<p class='c011'>Dylar and Elena talked with their guides in a
language that she had never heard before, yet
which she could almost understand.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a clear-sounding and sonorous language,
with a good deal of accent, and it almost sang.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will soon learn it,” Elena said. “It is
the flower of all languages, not yet rich, but
pure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They mounted, and pursued their way. After
some hours the path began to broaden and descend.
They entered a pine wood, and the sun deserted
them, showing only on the tops of the highest trees.
The way was dim and fragrant, long brown aisles
of gloom stretched away at their left. But only a
fringe of trees stood between them and the crags at
their right.</p>

<p class='c011'>The path turned with a long curve, and they
were at the door of a dark old house, built of rough
stones, and set against a cliff. Opposite the door
a road went down into the pines, and disappeared.
The road by which they had come continued past
the door, descended gently, and disappeared around
the cliffs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The house had a sinister, deserted look. The
door was off the hinges, and set against an inner
wall. The rude shutters of an upper window hung
half open. Where the masonry of the house ended
and the natural rock began was not apparent. Nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>had adopted the rough stones, and set her
lichens and grasses in their interstices.</p>

<p class='c011'>A rivulet fell from the heights into a trough near
the door, twisting itself as it fell, and braiding in
strands of light. From the trough the water
overflowed, and followed the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not so bad as it looks,” Elena said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dylar came to assist Tacita. “I think that you
will be able to rest well here, unpromising as it
looks,” he said. “Do not be anxious. You will
be well guarded. And to-morrow your journey
will come to an end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As they entered the house, a man came hastening
down the stairs. He saluted Dylar with reverence
and Elena with delight. They spoke together
in the language the guides had used. The man
bowed lowly before Tacita, and smiled a welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>The room had no door but that by which they
had entered, and no furniture but a rough bench
and table. There was a cavernous chimney. The
floor was strown all about with twigs and pine-needles.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the guides brought in some boughs, and
kindled a fire on the hearth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dylar took leave of Tacita, and pursued his way
down the carriage-road leading by the rocks. In
parting he said,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“After to-morrow I will see you, if the King
wills.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A stair led directly from the room to a landing.
Two doors opened on this landing. One was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>closed. The other stood wide open into a chamber
that was in pleasant contrast with the room below.
A wide white bed, a deep sofa, a commode and
mirror, a table set with covers for two drawn up
before the sofa, and a second table holding roasted
fowl, salad, wine, and fruit promised every necessary
comfort. The room was rough but clean.
A gray muslin curtain was drawn back from one
side of the window, and there was a glazed sash in
a sliding frame at the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t it cosy!” said Elena, who seemed to be
overflowing with joy at finding herself so near
home. “Now, lie down on the sofa, dear, and you
shall have some soup as soon as it is hot. We
shall fare well. Our supper has been prepared by
the housekeeper at the castle, and sent in good
order.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must not ask what castle?” Tacita said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Castle Dylar, of course!” Elena said,
and went down stairs for the soup.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a sound from below of the door being
set on its hinges and barred, and the shutters were
closed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The guides will sleep below,” Elena said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Elena,” said Tacita, “what did Dylar mean
when he said ‘if the King wills?’ Who is the
king?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Christ Jesus,” replied Elena, bowing her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Evviva Gesù!</span></i>” exclaimed the girl with pleasant
surprise. “And is Dylar the master of Castle
Dylar?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“He is sole master!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Am I allowed to ask if he has any title of nobility?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is a prince,” said Elena.</p>

<p class='c011'>She asked no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later, when half asleep, she became aware of
strange sounds from below, as of a heavy weight
falling, and grating hinges.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be afraid,” Elena said. “The men are
putting the donkeys in their stable. And our
chamber door is strongly barred.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The sun was high when Tacita woke the next
morning. The chamber door was open, and an
odor of coffee came up the stair. The window sash
and curtain had been drawn back, admitting the
pine-scented air and a rain of sunshine that fell
over everything in large golden drops.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was late. “But that does not matter,” Elena
said, coming up with the coffee. “We could not
have started sooner. My brother had to come for
us; and it takes three hours. There were other
things to do besides. And when they were all done,
we talked over the incidents of a five years’ separation.
How glad I was to see him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tears were shining in her eyes. “There is no
haste. My brother has to prepare some things.
We go by an inner path, not the one Dylar took.
We travel in a southwesterly direction across the
mountains; and you will reach your chamber long
before sunset. I have thought that you would not
care to see any strangers to-night. Am I right?
Well, now we will go down. But first, I have a
word to say to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was something in her face that arrested
attention, an excitement that was almost a trembling.
“Tacita, do you remember all that your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>mother and grandfather told you, which you refused
to repeat to me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita made no reply in words. Already she
divined.</p>

<p class='c011'>The nurse leaned to whisper a word in her ear,
and give her a sign.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita looked at her with a mild surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>The nurse went to look out the window, and returning,
repeated her pantomime and whisper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well?” said Tacita wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dylar reproved me for having tried you in
Seville,” the nurse said, and again repeated the
whisper and the touch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I might have known!” Tacita exclaimed joyously,
embracing her. “I did almost know. It is
all that was needed to make me perfectly happy!
And now, let us start for home. At last I can
call it home! ‘By the side of a rock,’ my mother
said.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They went down stairs. There was no one visible,
and the door was still barred. Elena led her
companion into the niche under the stair, and
tapped on the stone wall. Immediately, as though
her light touch had pushed it, a part of the wall
receded a few inches, was lifted a few inches, and
swung slowly backward. It was a door of small
stones set in a plank frame, the irregular edges
fitting perfectly into the masonry about them. A
narrow, dim passage was visible, leading downwards.</p>

<p class='c011'>They descended, hand in hand, passing by a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>who stood there in the shadow; and the door was
closed and barred behind them. It was hung on
iron hooks that were round at the top, and square
below. When the bars were removed, and the
door freed from the wall, a pulley lifted it from the
square to the round iron on which it swung.</p>

<p class='c011'>The incline led to a small cave, scarcely larger
than the room above. It was all open to the west,
and an abyss separated it from a precipice, leaving
only a narrow shelf of rock outside the cave’s
mouth. Beside this shelf, no other egress was visible.</p>

<p class='c011'>The place showed signs of having been recently
used as a stable. For the rest, it might not have
been visited for years. There was an old chest
with rusty hinges, an old box full of pine-needles,
and some discolored blocks of wood that might have
served as seats.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is Arone, my brother!” said Elena, when the
man came down to them after fastening the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had a sunny face, and he resembled his sister
so closely that an introduction was scarcely necessary.
His dress set off a fine manly figure. It
was a gray cloth tunic reaching to the knees, and
girded with a dark blue fringed sash. Long gray
stockings and a gray turban-shaped cap with a blue
band completed his costume. The band of the cap
was closed over the left ear with a small silver
hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shelf of rock proved to be their path. Holding
by a rope fixed in iron hooks, they followed its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>curve to a small platform of rock. From this, a
bridge of two planks, over which the rope was continued,
crossed the chasm to a second shelf. This
was more dangerous than the first; for it was wet,
and the sheer rock it followed was dripping. Beyond,
in a wider path, were their guides of the day
before, and the donkeys.</p>

<p class='c011'>Holding the rope, Tacita passed the wet rock,
not daring to look downward, and was received by
her companions with a “Brava!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The worst was over. She sat down to get her
breath, and Arone returned to remove the ropes
and plank.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are going to see, in a little while, why our
path is wet,” Elena said. “Meantime, look about
you. Do you see that window?” pointing to a fissure
in the rock above the cave. Ropes extended
from this point to another not visible to them, but
in the direction of their pathway. “The closed
door you saw next to our chamber leads to that
room, and those ropes carry signals to a station
that is visible to a second station farther on. From
there they are repeated to a third, and that third
station we see at home. Anything that takes place
here can be known there in a few minutes. They
must know already that we have passed the bridge.
The house is not such a ruin as it appears, nor so
far away from everybody. There are several decent
rooms above; and it is only five miles round
by the road to Castle Dylar. There are always two
persons in the house as guard; and they are changed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>every week. From an upper window, like this,
hidden behind a fissure in the rock, all the roads
outside are visible. There are tubes leading to the
lower room through which the guard can converse,
or listen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita did not reply. She disliked mysteries,
having had reason to mistrust them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have no more secrets than we must, dear,”
her friend said, perceiving the signs of distaste.
“All that you have seen is necessary for the protection
of good people who have not strength to defend
themselves, and would not wish to use force,
if they could.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Arone, who had come back to them, looked at
the window over the cave, and blew a whistle. Instantly,
a bunch of long, colored streamers ran
along one of the ropes, and disappeared. While
they waited, Elena gave her charge a first lesson in
her mother’s native language, telling the names of
their guides, their animals, the rocks, lichens, and
the sky, with its light and sources of light. Then,
pausing, she raised her hand, and listened. There
was a stir, faint and far away, but coming nearer.
It became a rushing sound, and a sound of waters.
A huge white feather showed above the wet rock
underneath which they had passed, and a foaming
torrent leaped over its brink, plunged with a sharp
stroke to the shelf, and fell into the abyss. Their
whole path from the cave’s mouth to within a few
feet of where they stood was covered with the wild
rush of a mountain torrent.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“That is our beautiful gate,” Elena said. “It
needs no bolt. Now we will go. From here the
way is all plain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They rode for two hours over a hard mountain
path, where nothing but dark rocks, pine-trees,
and snow was visible. Then through a gap in the
mountains an exquisite picture was seen, lower
down, and not so far away but its features could be
examined. There was a green hill with sheep and
lambs, and a little cottage. Outside the door, under
the shadow of an awning, sat a man and woman.
The man was carving pieces of wood on a table before
him; the woman had some work on her lap
which kept her hands in constant motion. A
young girl came out of the cottage and brought her
mother something which they examined closely together.
They were all dressed in gray with bright
girdles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The man carves little olive-wood boxes and
bowls,” Elena said. “The woman and her daughter
make pillow lace. The girl is our very best
lace-maker. Her work brings a high price when
we send it out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The three continued tranquilly their occupations,
unconscious of being observed; and an interposing
mountain slope soon hid them from sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita began to feel that she had rested but superficially
the two past nights. She scarcely cared
to look at the changing views where distant snow-peaks
and occasional airy distances seemed to intimate
that before long they might emerge from their
mountain prison.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>The path descended gradually; there were
glimpses of pine-groves and olives. Suddenly they
made a sharp turn, and entered a cave much like
that they had started from.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At last!” exclaimed Elena, and slipped from
her saddle.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the cave they went into a long corridor
that led them to an ante-room with a curtained
glass door at each of the four sides. There was no
window. One of the doors stood open into a charming
bed-chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>The one large window of this chamber was covered
with a curtain of white linen in closely crowded
flutings that shone with a reflected sunshine. The
color of all the room was a delicate gray, with
touches of gilding everywhere. They glimmered
in a broad band of arabesques that ran round the
walls at middle height; on a bronze vase with its
long slender pen-sweep of a handle; on the lance-ends
of the curtain-rod; on the railing around three
sides of a little table that held a candlestick, bottle,
and glass at the bedside. There was a glistening
of gold all through the light shadow-tint.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Welcome! A thousand welcomes to San Salvador!”
exclaimed Elena, leading Tacita into the
chamber and embracing her with fervor. “May
all happiness and peace attend you here; and may
the place be to you the gate of heaven!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, dear, your fatigues are all over,” she
added. “You are at home!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“San Salvador!” repeated Tacita, looking about
her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“Do you wish to see and know more now, at
once?” the nurse asked smilingly. “There are no
more secrets for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no! Just now I appreciate too well our
Italian proverb: ‘The bed is a rose.’ And that
sofa seems to speak.” She went to sink on to its
soft cushions. “Go to your friends, Elena.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Presently. You must first be attended to.
There is a woman here who will serve you in everything.
She speaks French, and her name is Marie.
What are your orders?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My wish is to rest on this motherly sofa an
hour or two, without having to utter a word.
Then I would like a little quiet dinner, all alone,
after which I will go to bed and sleep as long as
nature wills. Those are my wishes. My sole
command is that you go to your friends at once,
and do not return to me till to-morrow morning.
My poor, dear Elena! What a care I have been
to you! Now let me see you take some care of
yourself. I have all that I want.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The woman, Marie, appeared with a cup of broth
on a tray. From her glad excitement, the tray
trembled in her hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, welcome home, Elena!” she exclaimed.
“Welcome to San Salvador, Tacita Mora! You
are a thousand times welcome! May the place be
to you the gate of heaven! I am so glad!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She set the tray before Tacita, but could spare
her only a glance as she uttered her hasty and
tremulous welcome. Then she ran to embrace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Elena. “Oh, welcome! welcome! You are looking
so well. You come laden with good news.
Stay with us! We will not let you go again. We
will give the moon in exchange for you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I should miss the moon,” Elena said laughingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a little while they went out together, leaving
Tacita to rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, then, is San Salvador?” she wondered,
sinking among the sofa-pillows.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps she might learn by lifting that sun-lighted
curtain. But she did not wish to lift it.
There was pleasure in tasting slowly the unfolding
mystery. So far, each revelation had been brighter
than the preceding. She slept content, and waked
to see on the curtain the deep hue of sunset.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a little while she lay looking about her, recollecting
herself, and examining her surroundings.
The floor was of yellow tiles, all the furniture and
bed-covers were of pale gray linen as glossy as
satin, the wicker chairs were graceful in shape, and
the tables gave a restful idea of what tables are
meant for, undefeated by sprawling legs and impertinent
corner-twiddlings. They were of fine
solid wood, dignified and useful, and set squarely
on strong legs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Glancing at the band of arabesques around the
walls, Tacita perceived that it had a meaning. It
was all letters—but letters run to flower or to
animal life. They budded, they ended in tendrils,
they were birds and insects, but always letters; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>as she studied them, they became letters that made
words in all the languages that she knew; and
doubtless those which she could not decipher were
words of languages unknown to her. And of all
those which she could read, every one repeated the
same words, over and over, whole, or in fragments,
each phrase held up as a honey-dropping flower:</p>

<p class='c011'><em>He shall feed his flock like a shepherd; and
sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>It was set down in clear text. Then a bird flew
with a part of it in his beak. <em>Like a shepherd,
Like a shepherd.</em> And the word <em>shepherd</em> stood
alone, all bloomed out with little golden lilies.
Dragon-flies and butterflies bore the promise on
their wings; and where it bore roses, every rose
had a humming-bird or bee sucking its sweetness
out. The quick squirrel ran with what seemed a
vine hanging from his upturned mouth; and the
vine was a promise.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the Moorish idea. She had seen among
their arabesques the motto of Ibn-l-ahmar: “There
is no conqueror but God,” so interwoven with ornamentation.
But that solemn Moorish reverence
and piety did not touch the heart like this consoling
tenderness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dinner was served on a table set before the window.
It was a charming little dinner: a shaving
of broiled ham; a miraculous soup; a bit of fish in
a shell; a few ribs, crisp and tender, of roasted kid;
rice in large white kernels; an exquisite salad of
some tender herbs with lemon juice and oil that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>like honey; a conserve of orange-blossoms, rich and
thick; a tiny flask of red wine from which all acrid
taste of seed and stem had been excluded; and
lastly, a sip or two of coffee which defied criticism.</p>

<p class='c011'>Evidently the cook of San Salvador was nothing
less than a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cordon-bleu</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dinner done a healthy justice to, and praised,
Tacita was once more left to herself. But first
Marie brought a vase of olive oil and water with a
floating flame, and set it in a little glazed niche in
the wall that had its own pipe-stem of a chimney;
and she drew back the window curtain. The lower
part of it had lost the sun; but a bar of orange
light crossed the top.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita waited till the door closed, then looked
out eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were still mountains in a rugged magnificence
of mass and outline; but the color left no
room for disappointment. They faced the west
with the kindled torch of a snow-peak above a tumult
of gold and purple and deep-red. There
were pines along the lower heights, and olives, and,
lower still, fruit-trees. A rock protruding close to
either side of the window narrowed the lower view.
But only a few rods distant, a wedge of smooth
green turf was visible, with a crowd of gayly-dressed
children playing on it, tossing grace-hoops,
chasing each other, and dancing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently the air was filled with a sweet, tinkling
music. The children ceased their play at the
sound, and formed themselves in procession, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>subsiding kitten-like skips, and passed along the
green, and out of sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she watched them, it occurred to Tacita for
the first time to think that youth is beautiful. It
is a thought that seldom occurs to the young, youth
being a gift that is gone as soon as recognized.
Her aching languor and weariness taught her the
value of that elastic activity, and her sorrow suggested
the charm of that unclouded gayety. Yes,
it is beautiful, she thought, that evanescent blush
of life’s morning forever hovering about the sterner
facts of human existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sat and looked out till the color faded from
the heights, leaving only a spot of gold aloft; and,
thinking that she must not go to sleep in her chair,
fell sound asleep in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was about midnight when she waked, and with
so vivid an awakening that to sleep longer seemed
impossible. In place of the languid quiescence of
the evening before, there was a consuming impatience
to know all without an hour’s delay. Close
to her was the unsolved mystery of her mother’s
birth and of her own fate. She could wait no
longer.</p>

<p class='c011'>She lighted her candle, and went softly out into
the ante-room. All was still. She tried the door
opposite her own. It opened on a broad stair that
descended between two blank walls.</p>

<p class='c011'>Closing the door noiselessly behind her, she went
down, candle in hand, and reached a corridor and
a second stair. Across the foot of this second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>stair shone a soft light. It was the same light that
shone outside her window above,—a passing moonlight
that had gathered to itself all the star-beams
in the air and all the frosty reflections of its own
crescent splendor from snow-clad heights and icy
peaks, and fused them in a lambent silver.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita set her candle on the stair, and went down
into a long hall, of which the whole outer side was
an arcade, and beyond the arcade was a piazza
open to the night, and with a wide space beyond
its parapet. As in a dream, she passed the arcade;
and before her lay San Salvador, the city of the
Holy King!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>San Salvador was built on a plain that might
once have been the bed of a lake formed by mountain
torrents partially confined. It was an irregular
oval, two miles in length from north to south, and
a mile and a half wide. As large an exact paralellogram
as the space would allow was surrounded
by a deep canal, or river, shut in by balustrades
on both sides, and having its outlet southward
through the mountains. This space was the town,
as compactly built as possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Across the centre, from east to west, ran a wide
avenue that expanded at middle length to a square.
Seen from a height this avenue and square looked
like a huge cross laid down across the town. Narrow
streets, alternating with single blocks of houses,
ran north and south, only an open space of a few
feet being left all round next the river. The cross-streets
did not make a complete separation of the
houses, but cut away only the basement and floor
above, so that one looked across the town through
a succession of arches.</p>

<p class='c011'>The houses were all of gray stone, three stories
high, with a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">patio</span></i>, a flat roof, and two fronts.
There was no sign of an outbuilding, nor was
there a blade of grass in the gray stone pavement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>that covered every inch of ground inside the river.
But there were plants on the roofs. At each end
of the avenue a bridge as wide crossed the river;
and there were four narrow bridges at each of the
four sides of the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the southern half of the square was a building
called the Assembly, from its use, or the Star-house,
from its shape. It had three triangular stories set
one over the other in the shape of a six-pointed
star, the protruding angles forming vestibules below
with their supporting columns, and terraces
above. These columns restored the symmetry of
the structure, and gave it grace and lightness.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the northern square was a low bell-tower with
a pulpit built against its southern side. The first
floor was an open room surrounded by arches.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the exception of these two structures, nothing
could be more monotonous in form and color
than the whole town; while nothing could be more
varied than its setting.</p>

<p class='c011'>That part of the plain outside the river, called the
Cornice, had a straight edge next the river and an
outer edge that showed every wildest caprice.
Sometimes it ran into the mountains in bays, in
curves and rivers, and sometimes the mountains
crowded it to within a few feet of the river. All
around rose the mountain wall, lined with hills,
gentle, or abrupt; and, inundating all, a flood of
verdure was thrown up on every side, like the
waves of a sea. The ragged edges of the plain
were heavy with wheat, rice and corn; higher up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>were orchards, vineyards, and terraced gardens,
and a smoke of olives curling about everywhere, and
groves of trees crowded into sunny hollows, and
wedges of pines thrust upward, diminishing till the
last tree stood alone beneath a gigantic cornice-rim
of rock, snow and ice,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Where the olive dare not venture,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the pine-tree’s courage fails.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Around the middle distance of this garden-zone
was a wavering path, now visible to the town, now
lost, with frequent dropping paths, half stairs, to
the plain. This path was called the Ring. Here
and there was a glistening watercourse, or cascade;
and the whole garden-circle was sparsely dotted with
little cottages, some of them scarcely more than
huts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two great masses of rock detached from the
mountains were connected with them by bridges.
That at the southwest was covered with a building
containing a school for boys, that at the northeast
had the hospital.</p>

<p class='c011'>Directly opposite the eastern end of the avenue
was the largest building in the town, called the
Arcade. Here was the girls’ school, and a hotel
for women.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was here that Tacita Mora stood, in the long
wide veranda that followed the whole irregular
front of the building, and looked for the first time
on the city of her birth. But of all this scene,
splendid by daylight, in that midnight hour she saw
only a bold mountain outline high against the stars,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>with an embroidery of shadows beneath, and lower
yet, a gray bas-relief that as it approached nearer
became houses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently, the waning moon came up over the
mountains behind the Arcade, and set a snow-peak
glistening opposite, and half unveiled a ghostly
sheeted avalanche, and penciled here and there a
clearer outline, and showed the embossed surface
of the plain cleft smoothly across from beneath the
veranda where she stood to something far away
that seemed like a white wavering cascade, with a
fiery sparkle above it as the moon rose higher.</p>

<p class='c011'>The desire to know more, to see nearer, to assure
herself by actual touch that this was not all a twilight
<em>mirage</em> became irresistible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be free as in your father’s house,” Elena had
said to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no sign nor sound of any one abroad.
The soft rustle of running waters alone moved the
silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita found the last stair and went out. In
that delicate airy illumination the avenue disclosed
itself before her, and the white object far away
became stationary. But the sparkle above it had
disappeared. She went forward timidly, pausing
to listen, turning to retreat, and again advancing,
at once resolute and afraid.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few silvery bird-notes floated through the silence;
a white network of cloud, like a bed of
anemones, veiled the moon’s crescent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita, gathering courage and excited by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>spirit of adventure, hastened till she reached the
Square, paused there but a moment, and then hurried
on toward that white object which was her
goal. It was a little above the level of the town;
it took shape as she drew nearer, and became the
façade of a white building with a fragmentary glimmering
across it and above; it showed a background
of dark rock, and a plateau in front surrounded
by a white balustrade. In all the town
there was nothing white except this building and
the balustrade raised and overlooking every other
building. In a Christian community only a church
would be so enthroned.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita crossed the bridge, and went to kneel on
the steps leading from the level to the inclosed
terrace. There was a smooth façade with a great
door in receding arches in the centre, above a flight
of white steps, five rose windows following the
arched line of the roof, and something like a gilded
lettering across the middle height.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the anemone-cloud drew away from the moon,
the letters grew distinct, and the text shone out
full and clear:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>I am the Light of the World.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>At sight of that shining legend aloft, something
stirred in the girl’s memory. A thick curtain of
years parted, showing a distinct fragment of the
past. Once, long ago, she had looked up at that
white expanse and seen upon its front the line of
shining figures. Her hands held the soft fold of a
dress, and a hand rested lightly on her head. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>her memory the bright figures were associated with
the idea of a great golden lamp, softly luminous,
swung by a golden chain down from the skies, and
of a face all radiant, and a sweet voice that said:
<em>Of such is the kingdom of heaven</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must have stood on this very spot with my
mother while she explained the words to me, and
told how he blessed little children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When the bee has gathered all the honey that
it can carry, it flies home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita’s heart was full. She wanted no more
that night.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there was no timidity in her return. The
place was walled in as by a host of angels. The
fold of her mother’s dress seemed yet within her
grasp, and the flowing water was a song of peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>The candle, burnt low, was where she had left
it on the stair, and all was silent and deserted on
the way up to her chamber.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“You have taken the edge off the surprise I
meant for you,” Elena said when Tacita told her
of her midnight walk. “But there still remains
something to please you with its novelty. Go and
see the Basilica. The door is open all day. You
can go alone, and will enjoy it more so than with
company. When you come back I will have your
new room all ready for you. It is in front, over
the great veranda, a little to the right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall I meet many people in the street?” Tacita
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will see very few; and they will all be on
some business. We are an industrious community,
and there is no one who has not something
to do in the morning. It is only toward evening
that we walk for pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will any one speak to me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Probably not; but they will bow to you. You
have only to bow and smile in return.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can I smile to everybody?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If the smile wants to come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Elena, that is the best of all!” Tacita exclaimed.
“Sometimes I have met strangers whom
it seemed impossible to pass without notice. Perhaps
the person appeared to be in trouble, or was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>uncommonly <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">simpatica</span></i>; or for the moment I happened
to feel strongly that we are all ‘poor banished
children of Eve.’ It was an affection that I cannot
describe, as though it were heaven to sacrifice
your life in order to save or console another. I
gave, perhaps, a glance that rested a moment, or a
faint—oh, so faint!—hint of a smile; and I was
always pained and mortified, the person would look
so surprised. It showed me plainly that the earth
is indeed accursed when our kindest impulses are
so misunderstood.”</p>

<p class='c011'>While speaking, she put on a new dress that
Elena had brought her. It was a long robe of thin
dark blue wool, bound at the waist by a silken sash,
a lighter tint of the same color. The wide straight
sleeves fell over the hands, or were turned back,
such sleeves as may be gathered up under a brooch
at the shoulder. A long scarf of the woolen gauze
served to wrap the head and neck, if necessary.
There were gloves of fine white kid and russet
shoes with silver buckles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena wore the same style of dress in gray.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gray is our working color,” she explained.
“Sometimes it is worn with leathern belts, or
sashes of another color. Gray alone, or with
black, or white, is mourning. White is our highest
gala. The very old wear white always. It
gives that look of cleanliness and freshness which
age needs. The children are our butterflies.
They wear gay colors. We never change the
form of our dress. The only variation is in color
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>and material. I think that you will scarcely find
anything more graceful, modest, or convenient.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s the prettiest dress I ever had,” said Tacita.
“And now—and now”—</p>

<p class='c011'>They went down stairs and stepped out into the
veranda, and the full splendor of what she had
seen but in shadow burst upon Tacita’s view.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was every shape and shade of verdure, and
every shape of barren rock and gleaming snow.
There were mists of rose, blue, and gold that were
flowers. There was every depth of shadow, from
the tender veil as delicate as the shadow of eyelashes
on the eye, to the rich dusk lurking beneath
some wooded steep or overhanging crag.
The houses were of a silvery gray, bright on the
roofs with plants and awnings. Wherever there
was water, it glittered. The façade of the Basilica
was like snow, and its five windows blazed in the
morning sun. The wavering path that threaded
the gardens was yellow, and shone with some
sparkling gravel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita leaned over the balustrade and looked
right and left. At every turn some lovely picture
presented itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no one in the avenue,” Elena said.
“But the archways will be cooler.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita chose the deserted avenue, and walked
timidly, almost without raising her eyes, till the
second bridge was passed, and the Basilica rose before
her, standing out from a mass of dark rock
that almost touched the tribune.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Nine steps of gray stone led up to the white
balustrade. Within, at either side was a square
of turf, thick and fine, separated and surrounded
by a path of yellow gravel, sparkling with little
garnets. Three white steps above led to the double
door, now wide open. There were inscriptions on
the fronts of the steps. The upper one bore in
Latin that most perfect of all acts of thanksgiving,
<em>We give thee thanks for thy great glory.</em> The
vestibule was one third the width of the Basilica,
two narrow side doors, unseen from the front, having
vestibules of the same size. This was entirely
unadorned, except by the two valves of the carved
door of cedar and olive-wood shut back against the
wall, and the shining folds of a white linen curtain
shutting an inner arch of the same size.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lifting the linen band that drew these folds
aside, Tacita was confronted by another curtain, a
purple brocade of silk and wool, heavily fringed.</p>

<p class='c011'>She dropped the linen behind her, and stood
cloistered between the two for a moment; then,
lifting a purple fold, stood before a screen that
seemed woven of sunshine. A gold-colored silk
brocade with a bullion fringe that quivered with
light closed the inner edge of the arch.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two contrary impulses held a momentary soft
and delightful conflict in her mind: an impatient
desire to see what was beyond that veil, and a restraining
desire to let imagination sketch one swift
picture of what was so delicately guarded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, holding her breath, she slipped past the
scintillating fringes and stood in the nave.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Flooded with the morning sunshine, the place
was as brilliant as a rainbow. Even the white
marble footing of the walls, and the two lines
of white marble columns, overhung with lilies instead
of acanthus leaves, caught a sunny glow from
that illumination. The walls, frescoed with landscapes
of every clime, showed all the rich hues of
nature. The blue ceiling sparkled with flecks of
gold, there were golden texts on the white marble
of the lower walls that condensed the whole story
of Judaism and Christianity. On the pedestals
of the ten lower columns were inscribed the Ten
Commandments. The pavement of polished green
porphyry reflected softly all this wealth of coloring,
and as it approached the tribune was tinted like
still waters at sunset. For the Basilica of San
Salvador was simply the throne-room of its Divine
King; and the throne was in the tribune.</p>

<p class='c011'>A deep alcove rising to the roof was lined with
a purple curtain like that of the portal; and raised
against it, nine steps from the pavement, was a
throne made of acacia wood covered with plates of
wrought gold. From the arch above, where the
purple drapery was gathered under the white outspread
wings of a dove, suspended by golden chains
so fine as to be almost invisible, hung a jeweled
diadem that quivered with prismatic hues. The
footstool before the throne was a block of alabaster;
and on its front was inscribed in golden letters:</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest.</em></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>The white marble steps were in groups of three,
each surmounted by a low balustrade of alabaster
hung with golden lilies between each snowy post.
A broad purple-cushioned step surrounded the
lower balustrade. Otherwise there was no seat
nor resting-place but the pavement.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita sank on her knees and gazed at that
throne that shone full of sunshine, half expecting
that the light would presently condense itself into
the likeness of a Divine Face. The crown hung
just where it might have rested on the brow of an
heroic figure enthroned beneath. And was there
not a quiver in the jewels as if they moved, catching
and splintering the sunrays on diamond points,
or drinking them in smooth rubies, or imprisoning
their fluttering colors in white veiled opals, or
showing in emeralds a promise of the immortal
spring of Heaven! And was there not a whisper
and a rustling as of a host preceding the advent
of some supreme Presence?</p>

<p class='c011'>She put aside her fancies, and made a heartfelt
thanksgiving to him who was truly there, then
rose and slowly approached the throne. The
work was all beautiful. The fluting of the columns
was exquisite, and every milk-white lily that
was twined in their capitals was finished with a
loving hand. On the fronts of the steps were
names of prophets, apostles and saints, highest of
all and alone, the name of Abraham surrounded by
the words he spoke to his son, Isaac, as they went
up the mountain in Moriah:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span><em>My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a
burnt-offering.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>Lower down were names of beneficent gods and
goddesses, all names which the children of men had
lovingly and reverently worshiped, each light-bearing
god or goddess with a star to his name.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita remembered her grandfather’s declaration:
“Show me the path by which any human soul
has climbed to worship the highest that it could
conceive of the Divine, and I will see there the footsteps
of God coming down to meet that soul.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her heart expanded at the thought. It seemed
the very spirit of the Good Shepherd gathering all
into his fold—all who lifted up their hearts in
search of something above their comprehension, but
not above their love.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a deep sigh of utter contentment she turned
aside, and walked down one aisle and up the other,
looking at the frescoes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wall of the three vestibules extended quite
across the Basilica with a wide gallery above; and
from the golden fringe of the portal to the purple
fringe of the apsis, one scene melted into another
with such artful gradations that there was no break
in the picture; and all ended against the ceiling
in mountain, or tree-top, or vine, or in a flock of
birds, so that it did not seem an ending.</p>

<p class='c011'>A glimpse of polar sea with an aurora of the
north and icebergs began the panorama; and then
came full streams overhung by dark pine-trees that
presently showed green mosses and springing delicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>flowers under their shadows. The scene softened,
and grew yet softer, till a palm-tree was
over-brushed by the purple curtain of the apse,
and a line of silvery beach, and a glimpse of sea
and of a far-away misty sun-steeped island just
escaped its folds. There were sunsets shining
through forest-reaches, brooks dancing over stones,
the curve of a river, the violet outline of a mountain
faint against the sky, lambs sunk in a green
flowery meadow and half submerged, looking like
scattered pearls. There were gray streaks of rain,
and a glimpse of a rainbow; there was sunrise
over bald crags where an eagle stood black against
its opal background. The butterfly fanned its capricious
way with widespread wings, the bee and
humming-bird dived into the flower, the stag stood
listening with head alert, the elephant pulled down
the fruit-laden branches, the dragon-fly spread its
gauzy wings; but nowhere was there any sign of
man, nor of the works of man.</p>

<p class='c011'>From one aisle to the other Tacita went, wondering
more and more of what famous artist this
could have been the crowning work. From the
portal at both sides the scenes were arctic; but
their procession was infinitely varied. The small
doors entering from the sides were scarcely visible
in rocks and arching trees. A heavy grapevine
climbing to hang along the ceiling seemed to hide
all but the tiny cove of a pond spotted with lilies,
amid which floated a pair of swans.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the left side, burning the jungle from which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>he issued, a tiger stood and stared intently at the
Throne.</p>

<p class='c011'>But in all there was no sign of man, nor of the
works of man.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Tacita reached the Arcade on her return,
Elena was waiting for her at the lower entrance,
and uttered an interrogative “Well?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no words! Don’t ask me about the
Basilica. I met some people coming back. How
well they stand and walk. Standing and walking
must be taught here. Every one understands it so
well. I kissed my fingers to a little girl, and she
came and touched my girdle, then brushed her
fingers across her lips, and ran away again before
I could stop her. Oh, it is all so lovely!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They went up to a pleasant chamber that looked
across the town. “This is your room, dear,” Elena
said. “The dining-room is just across the corridor.
We will have our dinner at our own little
table before the school-girls come in; and you can
be served in your own room any time you like. It
is but a step more to take. And here is the salon,
just beside you. It is but little used; for except
when a stranger comes, we do not visit in San Salvador.
Our houses are for our private life. We
meet frequently, may meet almost every evening at
the assembly-room in the Star-house; and as it is
open every day, and there are a good many nooks
and corners there beside the chief rooms, there is
always a place for a tête-à-tête, or a little company.
But some people will come here to see you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>You will like to make some acquaintances before
going to the assembly. I hope that you may feel
rested enough to go to-morrow night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The salon was simply furnished, and had no need
of other ornament than the view seen from its windows.
There was a single picture on the wall, representing
a young woman of a noble figure standing
erect, her arms hanging at her sides, and one hand
holding a scroll. She wore the costume of San
Salvador of a tawny brown with yellow sash and
scarf. Under one foot, slightly advanced, lay a
Cupid sprawling face downward, the fragments of
his bow and arrows scattered about. The face was
of a somewhat full oval, olive-tinted, with heavy
black hair drawn back from the temples, a delicate
rose-color in the cheeks, and sweet red lips. The
large dark eyes looked straight out with a lofty and
thoughtful expression. The whole figure was instinct
with a fine animal life, such life as sustains
a strong soul full of feeling and intelligence. All
the curves of the face were tender; but they were
contradicted by an assumption of reserve almost
too severe for beauty. It was the picture of a loving
nature that had renounced love.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is our Iona,” Elena said. “She is the
Directress of the girls’ school, and she is the
women’s tribune. All classes have with us their
tribune, or advocate. Iona has traveled and
studied in both continents. She has advanced so
far in astronomy that she teaches it even in the
boys’ school. Would you like to have her teach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>you our language? She has offered herself as
your teacher.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If she will take the trouble, I shall feel honored.
What a noble-looking creature! Is she a
native of San Salvador?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; and she has a brother here who has never
been outside. Ion is one of the cleverest boys we
have. Their parents died when they were very
young.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Later, when they had eaten their dinner, and
Tacita was alone, there was a tap at the door, and
she rose to meet the original of the portrait. Iona
had tapped with her ivory tablets, and was pushing
them into the folds of her sash as she entered.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was something electric in the instant during
which the two paused and looked at each other
without speaking. Then Iona stepped forward,
gentle, but unsmiling, laid a hand on Tacita’s arm,
and, bending, kissed her lightly on the forehead.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are welcome to San Salvador!” she said
with deliberation, in a melodious, bell-like voice.
“I hope that you will be contented here. Does
the place please you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am enchanted!” Tacita said. “I ask myself
continually if I have not found the long-lost garden
of Eden.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The two contemplated each other with something
more than curiosity. Tacita was conscious of a
certain restraint and something akin to disappointment
while talking with this woman, who was even
more beautiful than her portrait. The form, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>teeth, the mass of hair were the most superb that
she had ever seen; and though the skin was dark,
every faintest wave of color was visible through it.
While she talked, the color deepened in her cheeks
till she glowed like a rose.</p>

<p class='c011'>The blue dress with its silver clasps might have
been too trying to her olive skin but for this lovely
blush.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona proposed herself courteously as teacher, and
Tacita thankfully accepted, offering herself in return
for any service she might be able to perform.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be quite at ease!” her visitor replied, not unkindly.
“You will soon have an opportunity. I
have already thought that you might be willing to
assist in the Italian classes. You speak the language
beautifully. But for some time yet you will
have employment enough in seeing the place and
becoming acquainted with the people and their customs.
Of course Elena has already told you that
there need be no restraint on your wanderings.
Every one you meet will be a friend, whether he
can tell you so or not. The language most useful
to you will be French, though there is scarcely a
language, living or dead, which some one here does
not speak.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita begged to know something of the government
of San Salvador.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have a few general principles which give
form to every detail,” Iona said. “For personal
disorders in the young, parents and teachers are
held responsible; for any social disorder, our rulers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>are held responsible. Probably, all blame is
finally laid on the father and mother, and more especially
on the mother. The training of the child
is held to be of supreme importance, and there
is no more dignified occupation. We say, ‘The
mother of children is the mother of the state.’ No
diseased or deformed person is allowed to have
children. You will not hear any mother in San
Salvador complain of her child as having a bad
temper, or evil dispositions. She would be told
that the child was what she made it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The children stay at home till they are about
four years of age. Then their whole day is spent
at school, where all their meals are taken. The
mothers take their turns, all who have not infants,
as matrons of the schools, a week at a time. Their
sole duty is to see that the food is good and sufficient,
that the little ones have their nap, and that
their health is thought of. I suppose you know
that we have public kitchens where all the cooking
is done. The kitchen for the children is by
itself, and so is that for the sick. Here also the
ladies serve their week in a year or thereabout, as
matrons. They make the bill of fare, and have an
eye to the sending out of all but the food for the
children and the sick, these having their special
matrons.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We do not lay much stress on the form of
a government. The important thing is personal
character. A republic may be made the worst of
tyrannies; and an absolute monarchy might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>beneficent, though the experiment would be a dangerous
one. The duty of a government is to obey
the laws and compel everybody else to obey them.
That is literal. We have no sophistries about it.
Of course, Dylar is our chief, and in some sense
he is absolute. Yet no one governs less than he.
We take care of the individual, and the state takes
care of itself. Moreover, the Dylar have always
been the first to scrupulously obey our laws and
observe our customs. There is a council of elders;
Professor Pearlstein is president. No one under
sixty years of age is eligible. Each class has a tribune
chosen by itself. I hold a sinecure as tribune
for the women. I fancy”—looking at her companion
with a smile of sudden sweetness—“that
you may be our long looked for tribune for the
children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely it should be a mother to hold that
office,” Tacita said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Think a moment!” said Iona, her smiling eyes
lingering on the sweet face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is true,” said Tacita slowly. “Parents do
not always understand their own children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are sometimes cruel to them when they
think themselves kind,” Iona said with energy.
“They sometimes ruin their lives by their partiality.
They sometimes tread as with the hoofs of a
beast on the feelings of the most sensitive of their
flock. How often are children mute! The finer
they are, the more isolated are their puzzled and
often grieving souls. They sometimes suffer an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>immense injustice without being able to right themselves,
or even to complain; and this injustice may
leave them morally lame for life. Children should
be shielded from pain even as you shield a young
plant from the storm. When the fibres of both
are knit, then give them storm as well as sunshine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see that the boys and girls are kept apart both
in their education and socially,” Tacita remarked.
“I have heard that point discussed outside.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will never be discussed here,” said Iona with
decision. “All have equal opportunities; but they
do not have them in common. The result justifies
the rule. When the boys and girls approach a
marriageable age they are allowed a free intercourse
and free choice. In questions concerning the honor
of the state we have no theorizing; and the state
has as much interest in the child as the parent has.
It has more. The parent suffers from the sin, or
gains by the honor of his child for but a few years;
the state may suffer or profit from the same cause
for centuries. Besides, a well-organized and orderly
government is of more importance to the
well-being of every individual than any other individual
can be. The love of no individual can
console a man in the midst of anarchy, or when he
is the victim of a tyrant. You have to thank your
parents for human life, if you hold it a boon; and
you have to thank your government for making that
life secure and free.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if you have not security and your reasonable
degree of freedom?” asked Tacita.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“Then the greater number of your people are
bad, and the few have an opportunity to be heroic.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My grandfather had no respect for the opinions
of majorities,” Tacita said. “He said that out of
a thousand persons it was quite possible that one
might be right and nine hundred and ninety-nine
wrong. He said that the history of the world is a
history of individuals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Iona rose to go, the door opened, and Elena
came in followed by Dylar.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita went with some agitation to meet this
man, who was still, to her, a mystery. Nor was he
less a mystery when she found him simply a dignified
and agreeable gentleman, with nothing strange
about him but his costume of dark blue cloth, a
sort of cashmere of silk and wool, soft and softly
tinted. It was made in the Scottish, or oriental
fashion, with a tunic to the knee and a silken sash
of the same color. He wore long hose of black
silk, silver buckles to his shoes, and on his turban-shaped
cap, made of the same blue cloth, was a
silver band, closed at the left side by a clasp of a
strange design. A hand pointing upward with all
its fingers was set inside of a triangle that was inclosed
in a winged circle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seeing Tacita’s glance touch this symbol more
than once, Dylar explained it. “We have all some
badge, according to our occupation,” he said.
“The hand is manual labor. I am a carpenter,
and have served my apprenticeship, though I seldom
do any work. The triangle is scientific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>study, and the winged circle is a messenger. All
those who, having their home here, go out on our
errands, wear this winged circlet. It is the only
badge I really earn; but I wear the three as Director
of all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope that I may be allowed to earn one,”
Tacita said, trying to settle her mind into a medium
position between the strange romance of her
first impressions of this man and the not unfamiliar
reality of their present meeting. The penetrating
eyes were there; but they only glanced at her
kindly, and did not dwell. A slight smile, full of
friendliness, illumined his face as he spoke to her;
but between it and her there floated a shadow-face,
having the same outlines and colors, but fixed in a
gaze of intense and self-forgetful study.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not clairvoyant,” he said presently, his
eyes laughing; “but I fancy that your thought has
made a flight to Madrid during the last few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could I help it?” she said blushing. “I could
not venture to ask; but”—</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can ask anything!” Dylar said. “If you
show no curiosity, I shall think you indifferent. I
am told that the resemblance is striking. Of
course I cannot judge. The original of that portrait
was the founder of San Salvador, and a
Dylar, my ancestor. But, my lady, I had already
seen something more than a picture resembling you
when we met in Madrid. I had seen yourself, not
alone in Venice, but years before, in Naples.
You spoke to me. Do you remember?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Oh! I could not have looked at you and forgotten,”
she answered with conviction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pardon! You looked and spoke. And you
gave me an alms.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He searched in the folds of his sash for a coin,
and showed it to her. It was an Italian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">baiocco</span></i>
polished till it looked like gold.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You went to Naples ten years ago with your
mother and grandfather,” Dylar said. “You visited
the Museum. Two men were seated side by
side on the steps as you went up, a young and
an old man; and the old man stretched his hand
out for alms. Your mother gave him something.
The young man did not ask, but you gave him this
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">baiocco</span></i>, and you said, ‘My brother, I am sorry
that it is not more.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment she could not speak. Then she
said,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was taught to call the poor brother and sister.
I could not know that I was taking a liberty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The liberty of heaven!” said Dylar. “Well!
I thought that you would come here some day.
And you are here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He rose, looking down, as if to temper somewhat
the joyousness of his exclamation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ask all the questions you choose,” he said.
“Do in all things as if you were in your father’s
house. Farewell, till we meet again.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>All the social life of San Salvador centred in
the Star-house, or assembly rooms, in the Square.
This was open at all times to all classes, with certain
restrictions. No one should go there in a
working dress, nor except by appointment to meet
some one, nor when any other convenient rendezvous
was available, and no one should enter a room already
occupied. It was on no account to be used
as a lounging place. The result of these regulations
was that all but the library and reading-room
were usually deserted by day.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lower floor was the music and dance-room,
and was so constructed, the floor being supported
entirely from beneath, and detached from the
walls, that no jar was communicated to the rooms
above. The only vestibule to this room, entered
directly from the Square, was that formed by the
pillars supporting the protruding angle of the story
above. Inside, the corner opposite the door was
railed off and raised for an orchestra. The angle
at the right was curtained off for a dressing-room,
and the third, entered from the outside, contained
the stairway. The two upper floors were divided
in nearly the same way; a large, hexagonal room
with a supporting cluster of columns in the centre,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>and three small rooms walled or curtained off in
the angles, one containing a staircase.</p>

<p class='c011'>The salon on the second floor was reserved for
conversation, the third floor was a library and
reading-room, and there was a terrace on the roof.</p>

<p class='c011'>The structure was solidly built, and, for the
greater part, very plainly finished. There was a
cluster of columns in the centre of the two upper
rooms inclosing a slender fountain jet in a high
basin. The lights were all placed around these
columns, and from each of them an arch vaulted to
a pilaster in each of the six angles of the room.
In the upper floor the walls were covered with
book-cases, in the lower they were tinted a dark
red with a fresco in each side of a Muse or dancer.</p>

<p class='c011'>The partitioned angles were draped with curtains
colored like the walls.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second floor, the salon <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</span></i>, was
more brilliant. The walls were lined with small
faceted blocks of white glass set in an amber-colored
cement, the curtains of the angles were of
amber-colored silk, the chairs, divans, sofas, and
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">amorini</span></i> were covered with an amber-colored linen
that looked like satin, the floor was of small alternating
amber and dark green tiles, the heavy rugs
were amber colored. It was a room all light, except
the dark green divan that surrounded the
cluster of pillars.</p>

<p class='c011'>These rooms were lighted till ten o’clock every
evening but Sunday, and were free to all; but the
inevitable law of selection had made it a tacit custom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>for certain persons to go on certain evenings.
To meet a stranger, it was considered proper to
give place to those who had been outside.</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena brought out a beautiful lace dress that
Tacita’s mother had left behind her on going out
into the world. It was of pillow lace woven in
stripes, and made over a soft silk in broad stripes
of rose and cream-color. Dressed in it, Tacita
looked like a blush rose.</p>

<p class='c011'>They set out for her first assembly at early twilight.
Lights in the houses showed them the way,
there was a sound of violins in the dewy air, and
figures flitting in the dance-room, and outside a
number of persons were dancing gayly in the light
that shone from the building.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our people are much given to dancing,” Elena
said. “And we have the most beautiful and complex
fancy dances in the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They went up a winding stair, that started in a
lower angle and ended in a terrace, from which a
wide arched door opened into the salon, showing the
glittering walls, the full light, the tossing fountain
in its lightly shadowed seclusion, the silken curtain
of the opposite boudoir, and a company almost filling
the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>The music came softened from below, allowing
the voices to be heard.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dylar and Iona met the two as they entered, and
Tacita found herself in the midst of the most cultivated
and charming company she had ever seen.
But for their costume, they would not at first have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>seemed different from any other gathering of well-bred
people who meet with pleasure a welcome
guest; but the stranger soon felt in their greeting
the difference between mere courtesy and sincere
affection. It was a repetition of the heart-warming
phrase that told her she was “in her father’s
house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The costumes gave an air of romance and unreality
to the scene. As Tacita looked about with a
pleased wonder, these figures suggested Arcadian
groves, Olympian slopes, or some old palace garden
shut in by high walls, with fragrant hedges of
laurel and myrtle over-showered by roses, with a
blush of oleanders against a mossy fountain, the
dim stars of a passion-vine hung over a sequestered
arbor, and crumbling forms of nymphs, lichen-spotted
in the sunshine. These figures would have
harmonized with such scenes perfectly.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the green velvet divan sat several old men
and women who wore long white robes of fine wool
with silken girdles. All the younger ladies wore
the same straight robe, made in various colors,
with silken fringed sashes, and fine lace at the neck
and wrists. Some wore lace robes like Tacita’s.
A few had strings of pearls; but no other jewels
were visible.</p>

<p class='c011'>The gentlemen, on the contrary, seemed much
more gayly dressed than in any other modern society.
Their costumes were all rather dark in
color and without ornament; but the silver buckles
on their shoes and the silver badge on the turban
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>cap which each one carried in his hand, or under
his arm, brightened the effect, and they all wore
lace ruffles at the wrists and laced cravats. Dylar
wore violet color, and a silver fillet round his
cap.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the more than a hundred persons present, all
but the youngest had been outside, and spoke other
languages than their own. Some were natives of
San Salvador living outside, and returned but for a
time. Tacita found herself charmingly at home
with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a while Dylar drew her apart, and they
seated themselves in a boudoir.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will observe the absence of jewels in our
dress,” he said. “This is only our ordinary way
of meeting; but there is no occasion on which
gems are worn here as elsewhere. With us they
have a meaning. Diamonds are consecrated to the
Basilica. Other stones are used as decorations for
some distinguished act or acquirement. The ruby
is for an act of heroic courage, the topaz for discovery,
the emerald for invention. Pearls are
worn only by young girls and by brides at their
wedding. When you marry, we will hang pearls
on you in a snow-drift.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He bent a little and smiled into her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita blushed, but made no reply immediately.
A feeling of melancholy settled upon her. Could
it be that she would be expected to marry?—and
that he would wish to select a husband for
her?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“Elena does not marry, and Iona is not yet married,”
she said after a silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, there is perfect freedom,” said Dylar.
“But Iona is only twenty-six and Elena scarcely
over forty years of age. Both may marry yet.
Now there is a gentleman coming in who wishes
very much to see you. He has just come from
England, and will return in a few days. Shall I
call him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She consented cordially, and Dylar beckoned the
young man to them, and having presented him, retired
and left the two together. A moment later
she saw him go out with Iona by the way leading
upstairs. They were going either to the library
or terrace.</p>

<p class='c011'>How well they looked together, though Iona was
almost as tall as Dylar. She wore amber-color that
evening, which became her, and her cheeks were
crimson, her eyes brilliant. For a little while
Tacita had some difficulty in attending to what her
new companion was saying, and in making the
proper replies. Then something in his manner
pleased her, and drew her from her abstraction.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was simply a well-bred young Englishman in
a sort of masquerade, which, however, became him
wonderfully. He had hair as golden as her own,
and he wore dark blue. While talking with him,
Tacita, woman-like, looked at the wide lace ruffle
that fell back on his sleeve. It had a ground of
fairy lightness, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vrai reseau</span></i> as strong as it was
light, with little wide-winged swallows all over it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>in a fine close <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">tela</span></i>, with a few open stitches in the
head and wings. She wondered where she had
read of swallows that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—“hawked the bright flies in the hollows</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Of delicate air.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“You are admiring my ruffles,” the young man
said with the greatest frankness. “They were
made here, and belonged to my father. I have
refused a good deal of money for them. Of course
you have learned that they make beautiful lace
here. I think it the finest lace made in the world,
taking it all in all. Look at that dress of yours,
now. How firm and clear it is! That’s pillow
lace, though, and this is point. There’s a kind
of cobweb ground to some rare Alençon point that
is wonderful as work; but you don’t dare to touch
it. I’ve seen a fine <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jabot</span></i> belonging to one of the
Bonaparte princes, and worn by him at a royal marriage.
You’ll sometimes see as good a border of
medallions as that had, but not such a centre, lighter
than blonde. It was scattered over with bees that
had only alighted. Each wing was a little buttonhole-stitched
loop with a tiny open star inside. As
a <em>jabot</em> it could be worn; but as ruffles, you would
have to keep your hands clasped together over the
top of your head.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man proposed after a while that they
should go up and see the library, and Tacita somewhat
shrinkingly consented.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Dylar should be there, I hope he will not
believe that I followed him!” she thought.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>He was not there. The large room was quiet and
deserted. Shaded lamps burned on the green-covered
tables, folds of green silk were drawn back
from two lofty windows closed only with casements
of wire gauze. Globes, stands of maps, movable
book-rests, and cases of books of reference were all
about. From the stairway and through the open
windows the hum of conversation came softened to
a hum of bees, the sound of viols from the dance-room
was a quivering web of silver, and the feet of
the dancers did not make the least tremor in the
firmly set walls.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The library is not a very large one, you see,”
said Tacita’s guide. “It is nearly as much weeded
as added to. It is surprising how much literature
thought to be original is found out to be only a
turn of the kaleidoscope. I won’t quote Solomon
to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My grandfather,” Tacita said, “used to say
that one folio would contain all the thoughts of
mankind that are worth preserving, and ten all the
commentaries worth making on them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is the way they condense here,” said her
companion. “For necessarily San Salvador must
be a city of abridgments. Say that ten authors
write on some one subject worthy of attention.
The best one is selected and then interleaved with
extracts from the others. To this is added a brief
notice of the authors quoted. It’s a good deal
of work for one person to do; but it saves the time
of everybody else who has to read on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Returning to the Salon they found that Dylar
and Iona had come down from the terrace, and some
boys were carrying about cups of a pleasant drink
that seemed to be milk boiled, sweetened, and delicately
spiced.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Iona must take you up to-morrow night to
look at Venus,” Dylar said. “It is very beautiful
now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bells rang ten o’clock, the signal for going
home, and they went down stairs. Dylar took
leave at the door; but the young Englishman asked
permission to accompany Tacita and Elena to their
door. The music had ceased in the dance-room,
and the lights were half extinguished; but the last
couples came out still dancing, humming a tune,
and, hand in hand, danced homeward.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will like to see our fancy dances,” Elena
said. “Some of them are very dramatic. There
is a good deal of grace and precision in them, but
no parade of agility. I know nothing more disgusting
than the flesh and muscle exhibition of the
ordinary <em>ballet</em>. Some of our dances require quite
as much command of muscle, but there must be no
effect of effort. To see a woman gracefully draped
float like a cloud is quite as wonderful as to see her
half naked and leaping like a frog. We have a
Sun-dance, with the whole solar system; and I assure
you the moons have to be as nimble-footed as
the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">chulos</span></i> of a bull-fight. The Zodiac dance is
more like a minuet in time. There are twelve
groups which keep always the same position with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>regard to each other; but the whole circle slowly
revolves, having two motions, one progressive. It
is a science, and requires a good deal of practice.
Iona used to be the lost Pleiad, and wandered about
veiled, threading the whole maze, but never finding
her place. Of course all are in costume; and it is
an out-door dance, occupying the whole Square.
Her part was like some little thing of Chopin’s,
plaintive, searching, and unanswered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When the two had gone up stairs, Elena said:
“Do you think that you would ever be willing to
marry the young man who came home with us to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no!” Tacita exclaimed. “What should
put it into your mind?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He wished me to ask you. I thought that it
was vain; but I promised to ask. If there is the
least chance, he will stay longer. If not, he will
go to-morrow. He has long known you by reputation,
and he admired you at sight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is not the least chance,” Tacita said decidedly,
and wondered why she should feel so angry
and pained.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The next day they went to visit the girls’ school.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Arcade was built around and above a promontory
of rock, the stories following it in receding
terraces, and the wings following backward at
either side, so that the effect from a little distance
was that of an irregular pyramid with a truncated
top.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a narrow vale and a green slope behind
one side, where the children played on that
first evening of Tacita’s in San Salvador; and here
they had their gardens cultivated by themselves,
their out-door studies and recitation-rooms and
play-ground. Thick walls, sewing-rooms, quiet
study-rooms, and rooms where the little ones had
their midday nap interposed to keep every sound
of this army of girls from that part of the building
used as a hotel, or home, for single ladies.</p>

<p class='c011'>Going from her quiet apartment to that full and
busy hive was to Tacita like going into another
world. In its crowd and bustle and variety it was
more like the outside world than anything that she
had yet seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>In one room two or three children were lying in
hammocks asleep. Out on the green a group of
them seated on a carpet were picking painted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>letter-blocks out of a heap, and discussing their
names. A girl a few years older, sitting near
them with her sewing, corrected their mistakes.
One lovely girl had a little one on her knee who
was reading a pictured story-book aloud. A larger
girl sat apart writing a composition, dragging out
her thoughts with contortions, like a Pythoness on
her tripod. In some rooms were young ladies
engaged in study, writing, or recitation. There
was a printing-room, with type-setters and proofreaders,
where one of the girls gave Tacita a little
book of their printing and binding.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everywhere were texts and proverbs on the
walls and doors, white letters on a blue ground;
and there was a throne-room where the little gilded
chair was filled with flowers for the children’s infant
king. Underneath was a picture of the three
Magi kneeling to the Child Jesus. This was in a
little temple on the hillside with a laburnum-tree
bending over it full of golden flower-tassels.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When they have acquired the rudiments of
learning,” Iona said, “we give them a touch all
round, almost as if without meaning it, to find
the keynote of their powers. It is done chiefly by
lectures. Ladies and gentlemen who have read
much, or traveled much, write short essays which
they read in school. If no child shows a special
interest in the subject, we let it go. Our object is
to give talent an opportunity, and also to waste no
time and effort where they will meet with no return.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All the accounts of the town are kept in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>schools, and well kept. It saves a great deal of
work. The kitchen accounts, for instance, are immense
and complicated; yet they are gleefully and
painstakingly smoothed into order by those busy
young brains and fingers. Promotion from one
class of these accounts to another is taken great
pride in. For instance, the girl who is ‘in the
salt,’ as they say, looks with admiring envy on the
girl who is in the wheat, the fruit, or the meat.
They are also taught to cook a few simple dishes.
For that they go to the kitchens. They all dress
alike, as you see, and there is no difference made
in any way. Even the genius, if we find one, is
not taught to set her gift above that of the most
homely usefulness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the visitors went away, a golden-haired girl
of ten or twelve years shyly offered Tacita a white
rose half opened, touched the fringes of her sash
with timid finger-tips and touched the fingers to
her lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her delicate homage was rewarded with a kiss
on the forehead. And, “Please tell me your name,
dear child!” said Tacita.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little girl blushed all over her face with a
modest delight, as she whispered “Leila!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My recollections of school are all pleasant,
with the exception of a few sharp lessons given
me there,” Elena said. “I well remember one I
received from Dylar the Eighth, father of our
Dylar. I was one day sent on an errand which
obliged me to go through the large dining-room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>where we eat now, and I saw a magnificent peach
there on the sideboard. I could not know that it
was the first and finest of a rare sort, and that
Dylar himself, who was in another part of the
house, had left it there in passing, and was coming
again to take it out for exhibition. But I did
know that we were never to help ourselves to anything
to eat without permission, and that I had
no right ever to take anything there. The peach
tempted me, and I did eat. I was looking about
for some place where I might hide the stone, when
the Prince returned. He went at once to the sideboard,
then turned and looked at me. No words
were needed to show my guilt. I stood speechless
in an agony of shame.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Prince looked at me one awful moment in
silence. Then he took me by the hand quite gently,
and led me to the room that has the commandments
of God on the walls, and pointed to the words,
‘Thou shalt not steal.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“He stood a moment beside me while I trembled,
and began to sob, then laid his hand, so
gently, on my head, and went away without a
word. My dear, it was the most effective sermon
I ever heard. You observe there was no sophistry
used. It was <em>stealing.</em> It was many a long day
before I could eat a peach without feeling as if I
had swallowed the stone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The next time the Prince came, I ran weeping
to kiss the fringe of his sash, and he kissed my
cheek, and whispered, ‘Don’t grieve so, little one!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Forget all about it!’ From that day to this I
loved Dylar above all earthly things. He was
forty years old and I was ten; yet he was the one
man in the world to me from that day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>While talking they had gone out, and were
walking northward in the outside road on their
way to see the kitchens. It was a paved street of
very irregular width. One side was bounded by
the straight line of the river parapet. The other,
narrowed to ten feet in width between the Arcade
and the bridge, widened sometimes to a rod or
two. And everywhere above were gardens, cottages,
steep paths and stairs, down-falling streams
and trees single, or grouped, or scattered.</p>

<p class='c011'>In one of the amphitheatres thus formed was a
semicircle of small shops, each with a wide awning
covering an outside counter. The goods were kept
inside, and brought out as called for. A man or
woman sat under the awning before each shop.
One was knitting, another was making pillow lace;
the man was making netting, and having but his
right hand, the peg had been fastened to his left
wrist, and he threw the cord in position for the
knot as rapidly as if the air were fingers to hold it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The kitchens were set high above the plain on
the eastern side of a deep ravine running northward.
Long buildings of only one story with attics
were surrounded by orchards, gardens, and
poultry-yards. There was a laundry, and countless
lines of clothes out in the sun. There was a bakery.
Beneath these buildings were the wine-caves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>and the rooms for pressing the grapes. Farther
up, on a rapid stream that came down and disappeared
under the pavement, was a little mill.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It looks small,” Elena said; “but all the wool
that makes our dresses is woven there. Our silk
webs we bring from outside, though we have a
small silk farm; but we raise all our own wool.
The silk we use for sashes and for hosiery. We
send out silk hose, lace, and carved olive-wood.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, my dear, you are to see the folly of
individual domestic cooking, and the wisdom of
having public kitchens, if they are properly conducted.
And at this moment you see coming to
meet us one of the chief supports of our system.
If we had not a lady of good taste and administrative
capacity to matronize our kitchens, they might
deteriorate, or fail. If even such a lady were always
there, she might sometimes grow weary and
careless; but with a short term for each, there is
always the sense of novelty and emulation to keep
them up to the mark.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a very pleasant presentation of a lady who
stood in the door to receive them, with a square of
white net tied, turban-wise, around her head, and
a snowy bib-apron over her cotton dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do not remember me,” she said, smiling
at Tacita’s intent gaze. “No wonder. You saw
so many strangers last night. Besides, my hair
was not covered then, and I wore a silk dress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was one of the most accomplished ladies whom
she had met at the assembly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>They went through the buildings that constituted
almost a village. It was the very paradise of a
cooking colony, in plenty order, and cleanliness.
There were no silver saucepans tied with rose-colored
ribbons; but Marie Antoinette might have
gone there and made a cup of chocolate or cooked
an omelette, without soiling her fair fingers, or her
dainty high-heeled shoes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The economy, too, was perfect. There were
central roasting fires on elevated hearths, with a
tunnel-shaped sheet-iron chimney let down over
them where a circle of tin kitchens and spits could
surround them, losing no heat; and there were lines
of charcoal furnaces set in tiles under great sheet-iron
hoods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We do not waste a bit of coal as large as a walnut,
nor a twig of wood that a bird could alight
on,” the Directress said. “For the food, not the
least important part of our establishment is the
fragment kitchen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Elena, when shall I come and learn to cook
something?” Tacita asked as they went away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her friend laughed. “You find it fascinating,
then! I shall have to make you begin at school.
You did not see the preparatory department there.
It is a sight, when they are busy for an hour every
morning, chopping meat, picking raisins, husking
corn, shelling peas, picking over coffee or rice,
doing, in short, any preparatory work that the
cooks might need. Sometimes they have half an
hour of such work in the afternoon. It would,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>perhaps, interest you more than to see them at
their books.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have often thought,” Tacita said, “that if
we could sometimes stop and watch the artisan at
his work, we might find it interesting. They know
so many things that the idle do not suspect. I especially
like builders of houses and monuments.
There is so much of poetry and religion in their
work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The artists who painted the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">affrescos</span></i> in the
Basilica learned cooking first,” Elena said. “It is
recorded of them that they were very promising
cooks, and came near spending their lives in the
kitchens. One day a gentleman observed them
arranging some fruit and vegetables with a very
artistic sense of color, and one of them showed
him a butterfly he had painted with vegetable
juices and bits of mica. One thing led to another.
Paint-boxes and paper were given them, and they
took fire. They were sent out to study. The
landscape painter had a fame in the world, and
died there. The one who painted the insects, flowers,
and animals, returned to San Salvador after a
few years, and never went away again. He taught
here. The schools were then started. Did you
see the ant-hill in those frescos? It is in the lower
left corner, just above Solomon’s text: ‘Go to the
ant, thou sluggard!’ An acanthus leaf half covers
it. But there are the little grains of sand perfect,
and the ants running with their building materials.
In one place two ants are carrying a stick, one at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>each end of it. It is a little gem. They recorded
of this man that it was his delight to search out
microscopic beauties that no one else had seen.
One said that he could intoxicate himself with a
drop of dew. Ah, how many a Psyche of beautiful
wings withers away in a dull imprisonment because
no Love has sought her out! It does not even
know why it suffers, nor what it wants. What an
escape little Giotto had! What would have been
his after-life if Cimabue had not paused to see
what the shepherd boy had drawn with chalk on
that rough piece of slate!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only a little before coming here,” Tacita said,
“I came upon a sentence in a book regarding
Giotto and the little church of Santa Maria dell’
Arena, of which he was both architect and painter.
The writer said: ‘Dante lodged with Giotto while
the works were in progress.’ Dante lodged with
Giotto! If I had been there, I would have put
rose-petals inside their pillow-cases. I once saw
an old picture with a portrait of Giotto in it. He
was dark-haired and bright-eyed, and he was
dressed all in white and gold, with a hooded mantle.
The hood was up over his head, showing only
a profile. He looked like a rose, and seemed full
of spirit and gladness. I hope that the picture was
authentic.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Elena with a sigh, “give them rose-petals,
those whom the world showers with laurel.
It is well. They also need sympathy. But my
thought turns ever backward to the uncrowned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the unpraised! My dear, I have gone among the
unknown of many lands, and I have found among
them such vision-seeing pathetic eyes in persons
whose lives were condemned to the commonplace
and the material that I hold him who can express
himself at his best to his fellow-man to be happy,
even if he has to die for it. True, to the second
sight, there is much of beauty in common things.
But a person born with an ideal sense of beauty,
and a vague longing to be, or to enjoy something
excellent, naturally does not look for it in poverty
and ignorance. Let us observe our contemporaries,
my dear. Perhaps we may discover where we least
expect it the motionless eyeballs of some imprisoned
and disguised immortal. How happy we, if
ours should be the first voice to hail such with an
Ave!”</p>

<p class='c011'>When Tacita was alone, she examined the little
book given her at the school. It was only a behavior
book for the pupils; but it contained some rules
not found elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When you are in the street, do not stop to
speak to any one you may meet without an errand
which makes it necessary, if it should be before
supper, and do not stop at all unless your first
movement toward the person should be responded
to with an appearance of welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not go to any person’s house unless an errand
compel you to; go and then, your business
done promptly, take leave at once, but without
hurrying, even if invited to stay.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“If at the assembly you see two or more persons
conversing apart, do not approach them unless
called, nor look at them as if expecting a call.
It is proper to pass them without saluting. Never
approach an alcove which is occupied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When kissing the sash of one whom you wish
to salute, be sure that your hands are quite clean,
and then touch only the fringe, which is easily renewed.
To touch the fringe and then carry your
fingers to your lips would be better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A page called “The Five Classes” reminded the
reader somewhat in its style of that high-minded
and gentlemanly, if rather Turveydropish philosopher,
Confucius:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“1. We begin our studies by acknowledging that
our teachers know more than we, and that we have
much to learn; and then we have the wisdom of our
age, and may be agreeable to the well-instructed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“2. We acquire the rudiments of a few studies,
and begin to think that we may soon know a great
deal; and we are still tolerable to the well-instructed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“3. We progress till we have a superficial knowledge
of several subjects; and then we are liable
to think ourselves so wise that we become disgusting
to the well-instructed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“4. We go a great deal farther, and if we
have good sense, we perceive our own ignorance,
and are ashamed of our past presumption; and
then we begin to win the respect of the well-instructed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“5. We progress farther and deeper, studying
with modesty and assiduity; and after many years
we learn that there is an ocean of wisdom to which
all that we could acquire in a thousand years is as
a drop of water; and then we are ourselves on the
road to be one of the well-instructed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It isn’t a useless lesson for any one to commit
to memory,” she thought, closing the book.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“It would be a great help to me if I could hear
the language spoken in a longer discourse, so as to
get the swing of it,” Tacita said one day to Iona,
after having taken a lesson of her. “In conversation
all my attention is occupied in listening to the
sound of the words, and thinking of their meaning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can have to-morrow just what you want,”
her teacher said. “Some of the college boys go
up to Professor Pearlstein’s cottage with their compositions.
He criticises both style and thought.
Some of the compositions, if not all, will be in San
Salvadorian. They will go up at eight o’clock in
the morning. When you see them come across
the town, follow them. You can do so freely. My
brother Ion is one of the boys; and I sometimes go
up to hear them. The cottage is a little above the
Arcade, toward the north, and has a red roof.
Half way up, the pathway branches. Turn to the
right, and you will come to a little boudoir in the
rocks from which you can hear perfectly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning, therefore, Tacita followed the
boys as directed, and presently found herself in a
charming mossy nook with a roof, and a thick
grapevine hanging between her and the little
terrace where the professor sat before his cottage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>door with half a dozen boys in a semicircle before
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Professor Pearlstein was a striking figure. His
handsome face was calm and pallid, his hair and
beard were white; and he wore a long robe of
white wool with a scarlet sash, and a scarlet skull-cap
like a cardinal’s. He was carefully dressed,
even to the scarlet straps of his russet sandals; and
an air of peace and orderliness hung like a perfume
about him and his small domain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita, screened by her vine-leaves, listened for
half an hour, eager to catch the thoughts through
the veil of this beautiful language which was so
sonorous and so musical, and was spoken with little
motions of head, throat, and shoulders, like a
singing bird.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then a boy addressed his master in French.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I considered the ways of a tree,” he said, holding
his manuscript in hand, but without looking at
it. “As soon as the seed wakes, it sends out two
shoots. One goes down into the dark earth, seeking
to fix itself firmly and find nourishment. The
other rises into the light, putting up two little
leaves, like praying hands, laid palm to palm.
The root searches in that chemical laboratory,
which is the earth, and is itself a chemist, and the
tree sucks up its ichor, and increases. The tree
also searches for food and color in sun and air.
The root feels the ever increasing weight which
rests upon it, and clings hard to rocks, and strikes
deeper when it feels the strain of a storm in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>fibres. It does not know what the sun is, except
as an unknown power that sends a gentle warmth
down into the dark, and calls its juices upward.
It does not know that of the particles of air which
here and there give it such a delicate touch as
seems a miracle, a fathomless and boundless sea
exists above where all its gatherings go to build the
tree. It does not know what beautiful thing it is
building there, all flowers and fruit and rustling
music. It crawls and gathers with the worm and
the ant, obedient to the law of its being, and draws
sweetness out of corruption, and clasps a rock for a
friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Master, I could not be content to think that
there is no more than this visible tree to reward
such labor, and that anything so beautiful as the
tree should be meant only to please the eye, gratify
the palate, and then return to chaos.</p>

<p class='c011'>“May there not be yet a third stage of this creature,
some indestructible tree of Paradise, all ethereal
music, perfume, and sweetness? That beauty
would be not in its mere existence, but in the good
that it has done; in the shade and refreshment it
has given to man; in shelter to nestling birds, and
to all the little wild creatures which fly to it for
protection; in the music of its playing with the
breeze and with the tempest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When it drops off the perishable part which
was but the instrument of its perfection, the humble
instinct in the root understands at last for what
and with what it labored.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“I remembered, O my master, that we in the
flesh are but the root of our higher selves, our sense
feeding our intelligence, which works visibly; while
above the body and the studious mind rises some
quintessence of intelligence which the spark of life
was sent to elaborate out of the universe on which
it feeds, a being all pure, all beautiful, which at
last gathers itself up into the light of Paradise,
dropping off corruption.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The picture-book of nature has given thee a
fair lesson, Provence,” said Professor Pearlstein,
smiling kindly on the boy; and then, with a few
suggestions and verbal corrections, allowed him to
resume his seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita did not need to be told that the boy who
rose next was Iona’s brother. He was graceful
and proud-looking, with an oval olive face, black
eyes and dark hair tossed back in locks that had
the look of plumes. He spoke in Italian, which he
pronounced exquisitely, with fullness and deliberation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have been haunted by a circle and a whirling
and a wheel,” he began, looking downward, his
head slightly bowed, as if in confusion. “I meant
to draw a lesson from the life of water. But when
I had followed a drop only half its course, a great
machine, all wheels and whirling, caught me up
and tore my thoughts to fragments.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I remembered having read somewhere that men
and women are but the separated parts of wheelshapes,
or circles which had been their united form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>in a more perfect state of being. Then I saw the
Hindu walking seven times around the object of
his sacred love, as the Mohammedan at the Cordovan
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ceca</span></i>, till his footsteps wear a pathway in the
stone. I remembered Plutarch’s story of the siege
of Alesia. When the city had to capitulate, the
general came out on his finest charger and dressed
in his finest armor, to surrender it. He rode round
and round the tribune on which sat Cæsar with his
officers, circled round and round them, then dismounted,
disarmed himself, and sat down silently at
Cæsar’s feet. That revolution had some meaning.
I remembered the whirling dervish, a clod with a
planetary instinct, and the Persian hell peopled
with beings which whirl forever in a ceaseless circle,
whirling and circling, the right hand of each
pressed to his burning heart. That naturally recalls
to mind the strange idea that the planets are
sentient beings, whirling forever with their hearts
on fire, like those accursed ones in the Hall of
Eblis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The planetary idea is in all this circling and
whirling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All the old nations have a legend of some great
supernatural battle in the past, where rebel and
loyal angels, gods and Titans, good and evil spirits
fought with each other. Those legends must
all be the reflection of a real event. I have wondered
if Chaos may not have been the crash and
ruin of such a combat, and Creation, as we have
read its story, a restoration only, instead of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the original establishment of order. Is not all this
whirl the search of scattered fragments for their
supplementary parts?</p>

<p class='c011'>“It might be, then, that there is no absolute evil,
but only an evil of wrong associations. There
are substances, as chemists know, which are deadly
in some combinations and wholesome in others.
There is the brute creation, which, perhaps, is but
a false humanity unmasked. Look at the trees.
Cut down an oak-tree and a pine-tree grows in its
place. Why not say, cut down a cruel man and
a wolf is born? And from that wolf downward
through fierce and gnawing generations, each losing
some fang and fire, what wore the shape of man
may become mud again. What if the real grandeur
of Christ’s mission may have been to release
all <em>men of good-will</em> from this primeval expiation.
First comes the figure, then the substance. <em>Let
there be Light!</em> said the Creator. And said
Christ, <em>I am the Light of the world.</em> Shone upon
by the sun, the foul and hateful may produce the
exquisite. From mud and dung we have the lily
and the rose. From this divine sun shining on <em>men
of good will</em>, we have the perfect man released from
a long captivity. The hell we hear of, the <em>outer
darkness</em>, of which the King’s Majesty spoke,
might be this going downward in the scale of being
of creatures which had arrived at humanity, but
were unworthy of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here, then, would begin another movement,
the Divine way of heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“It is all a whirl! Master, it makes me dizzy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Half laughing, the boy pressed his hands to his
temples.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ion,” said the master quietly, “it is well to
observe natural phenomena with the hope of drawing
some guidance from them in the supernatural.
Nature is like our sweet-toned bell in C. The material
stroke at the base brings out the keynote;
but if you listen higher up where the band of lilies
runs, you will hear the dominant whispering. This
is our limit. If the universe should propound its
riddle to me, I would lay my hand on my mouth
and my mouth in the dust.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would die guessing, or knowing!” cried the
boy. Then, with a quick change of expression, he
bowed lowly, and said in a quiet tone:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I considered the ways of water. It springs out
of the dark earth, is a rivulet, a brook, a river. It
labors, and never ceases to be useful till, laden with
impurities which are not its own, it falls into the
ocean. It has wet the lips of fever, washed the
stains of labor, helped to bear malaria from the
crowded city, revived the drooping plant, quenched
the devouring flame, sung its little song along the
roof and eaves, stretched its little film to soften a
sunbeam in the hot noon. It rests. No, it rests
not. It climbs into the sky only to return, and go
over it all again. It was depressing to think that
we may come again to go through the same round.
But who knows that the drop of water makes the
same round a second time? The variety may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>infinite. And so, I thought, the soul may come
and come, till it learns to sympathize with all.
May we not guess who has made many upward-growing
circles by saying, he can sympathize with
people in circumstances which have never surrounded
his apparent life, he can be compassionate
where others condemn, he can stand firm where
others fail, he is not moved by clamor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who can say?” said the master, passing his
hand across his forehead. “It is wiser not to ask.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it forbidden to speculate?” asked the boy in
a low tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not forbidden, Ion. But to spend the
present in speculating on the unrecallable past and
the unknown future is to throw away a treasure.
What happens when you try to look at the sun at
midday? You see nothing but a palpitating fire
that scorches your brain. Turn your eyes to earth
again, and do you see it as it is? No: everything
is discolored, and over it all are floating livid
disks that mimic the sun’s shape and slander his
color, the only souvenirs of an attempt to strain a
power beyond its limits. Do not try to read the
poetry and philosophy of a language till you shall
have learned its alphabet and grammar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet I learned German so, and was at the head
of my class,” said Ion boldly. “I opened a book
with Goethe’s name on the title-page, and turned
the leaves till I saw a poem that was as clearly
shaped for music as a bird is. I took the first letter
and learned its name and sound, and then the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>next and the next, till I had a word. I learned
that word, and the next in the same way, till I had
a verse and a thought. O master, what delight
when the dark shadows slid off that thought, and
it shone out like a star from under a cloud!
When, thought by thought, I had got the whole
poem out, every phrase perfect, and each delicate
grace with its own curves, then I knew German!
I plunged into the sea and learned to swim!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed with joyous triumph, and lifting his
arms, crossed them above his head, bending backward
for a moment, as if to draw a full breath
from the zenith.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man smiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou hast an answer ever ready,” he said,
“and thou art not all wrong, boy. I would not
clip thy wings. I like thy life and courage. But
I would that thou hadst something also of Holy
Fear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I like not the name of fear,” the boy said,
clouding over.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; if a man fear to do right,” said the master.
“But there is a noble fear of presumption,
and of setting a bad example. You have quoted
from our highly-honored Plutarch. Do you remember
what he tells of Alexander on the vigil of
the battle of Abela? He stood on the height and
saw over against him Darius reviewing his troops
by torchlight. They marched interminably out of
the darkness into the glare and out into darkness.
Those moving shadows on the morrow would become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>to him and to his army showers of arrows and
shock of spears, and trampling hoofs, and crushing
chariot-wheels, an avalanche of fierce death to
bear them down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then Alexander called his soothsayer, and they
set up an altar before the king’s tent; and there,
with the torch-lighted hosts of the foe before them,
they sacrificed to Holy Fear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the hour of battle came, did Alexander
therefore fail? No! The next day’s sun shone on
his victory; and ere it set poor Darius was a fugitive,
and his conquerer proclaimed Emperor of
Asia.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ion, thy danger is in rashness and in passion.
Guard thyself, boy! To-night, I pray thee, ere
thou sleep, go out alone on to the topmost terrace
of the college, and there in silence gaze for a little
while into the cloudless sky and consider the torchlights
of God’s great invisible encampment, cycles
and cycles of being, a measureless life of which we
know not the figure nor the language. And when,
so gazing, the fever of thy soul shall be somewhat
cooled, do thou also sacrifice to Holy Fear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ion listened at first with downcast eyes, then looking
earnestly at the speaker; and when the exhortation
was ended, before taking his seat, he went to
kiss respectfully the fringe of the master’s sash.</p>

<p class='c011'>Into the pause that followed there broke a sudden
clash of bells all struck together.</p>

<p class='c011'>The master and pupils glanced at each other and
all rose, uncovering their heads.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Tacita recognized the familiar <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">à morto</span></i> of Italy.
It signified here that some one was dying.</p>

<p class='c011'>The clash changed to a melody, and they all sang
together the hymn that had been sung that night in
Venice:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“San Salvador, San Salvador,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>We cry to thee!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>singing the hymn through.</p>

<p class='c011'>When it was ended, Tacita, perceiving that the
lesson of the boys would not continue longer, hastened
down the path before them.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had scarcely reached the level when Ion overtook
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“May I speak to you, Tacita Mora?” he asked,
cap in hand. “The master gave me permission to
follow you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely!” she answered, blushing. “But tell
me first for whom the bells were ringing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be Leila, one of the school-girls. She
was very sick last night. And this morning her
brother did not come to the college, so I knew that
she must be worse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did not I see you at the assembly?” asked
Tacita. “I had but a glimpse; but I think that
it was you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Ion. “It was my first admission.
I was sixteen years old the day before. We go
there at my age, and the ladies teach us politeness.
It is proper and kind for any lady to tell us if we
commit a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gaucherie</span></i>. They tell us gently in a
whisper. Pardon me if I still am awkward. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>am but a school-boy. I wanted to kiss the fringe
of your sash that night, and did not dare to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He bent to take her sash end, kissed it lightly,
and still held it for a moment as they walked.
There was something caressing and fascinating in
his voice and manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Looking down at the silken fringe, and letting
it slip tuft by tuft, he asked suddenly, “Do you
love my sister?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I admire her,” Tacita replied. “I have a sense
of subjection in her presence which forbids me to
use such a familiar word as love.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She builds up that barrier in spite of herself!”
the brother exclaimed. “She wishes to see if any
one will throw it down in order to get nearer to
her. She would sometimes be glad if it were
down. I know Iona.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can approach her nearly,” Tacita said.
“But who else would push down a barrier that she
raises round herself?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want you to,” Ion said earnestly. “I want
Iona to have some one to whom she can unveil her
mind more than she would to me even. Her relations
with our people are fixed. Half by her own
motion, and half with their help, she has been got
on to a pedestal. She is on a pedestal even to
Dylar. And there she must remain till some one
helps her down. See why I am so anxious about
it now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He took her sash end again, and held it, his fingers
trembling as he went on with growing passion.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“Next year some of our young men are going
out to take their places in the world. They are
all two or three years older than I; but I am a
century more impatient than all of them put together.
Naturally I should be expected to wait.
If I insist, I can go; only I am afraid it would give
pain to Iona. But if you love her, you can take
my place to her. She is sure to love you. I feel
your sweetness all about you in the air. At the assembly
a lady quoted something pretty about you:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Why, a stranger, when he sees her</div>
      <div class='line'>In the street even, smileth stilly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Just as you would at a lily.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Don’t let this barrier grow up between you and
Iona! Try to get inside of it, and help me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will do what I can, Ion,” Tacita said, beginning
to feel as if she had found a brother.
“May I speak of it to Dylar? I think that she
would show her mind more freely to him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I leave it all to you, and thank you,” the boy
said, warmly. “I shall die if I do not go! But
don’t tell them that I said so. I have such a longing!
Last year I climbed that southern mountain
we call the Dome. From the top I caught a
glimpse between the higher mountains of the outside
world. Oh, how it stretched away! Our
plain was as the palm of my hand compared with
that vast outspread of land. There were small
blue spots, so small that if I held two fingers up at
arm’s length, they were hidden. Yet they were
mountains like these. There were trees so distant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>that they looked a mere green leaf dropped on the
ground. I saw where the sun rises over the rim of
the round earth, and where it sinks again. How
I breathed! This is a dear home, I know. I
have seen men and women fall on their knees
and thank God, weeping with joy, that they were
permitted to return after having been long away.
But I cannot love San Salvador as it deserves till
I have seen something different.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita took in hers the boy’s trembling hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be comforted!” she said. “I will do all that
I can, and you are sure to go. It will not be long
to wait. Now, when you go about, look at San
Salvador and all that it contains with the thought
that you are taking leave of it. On the eve of saying
farewell, even a mere acquaintance seems a
friend.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were at the door of the Arcade. Ion took
a grateful, graceful leave.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Addio, O Queen of golden Silence!” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor little Leila is dead!” said Elena, coming
in later. “I was with her. It was she who gave
you the white rose when we were at the school.
You can now give one back.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Leila’s funeral took place the next day, the
lovely waxen figure carried on a bier strown with
flowers. The family surrounded their dead, a procession
of friends preceding and following. The
child’s home had been in one of the smaller apartments
of the cross-streets, reached by stairways
under the arches; and as it was the custom for
funerals to approach the Basilica by the avenue,
they came across to the eastward through alternating
light and shadow, and, reaching the outer
street, returned by the bridge in front of the Arcade,
the bells ringing <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">à morto</span></i> as they passed
through the avenue. But it was not the clash of
all the bells together. It was a plaintive dropping,
a tone or a chord, like dropping tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will they not enter?” Tacita asked in a whisper
of Elena when she saw that not only those preceding
the dead spread themselves around the outside
of the inclosure of the Basilica, but those who
followed were also remaining outside.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, my dear. The house of God is no place
for corrupting human bodies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bier was set down on the uppermost of the
first steps; two men with gilded staves drew
aside the curtains of the portal, and the lights and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>the Throne shone out on the mourning and the
mourned. A few prayers were said; and then, led
by the chimes, they all sang.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita knew enough of the language now to follow
the sense of their simple and brief appeal.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thou who didst mourn the friend that silent lay</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In the dark tomb, behold our eyes that weep</div>
      <div class='line'>A lifeless form that loved us yesterday.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mourning, we lay its silence at thy feet,—</div>
      <div class='line in10'>Thou who didst weep!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Help of the sorrowful! Help us to say</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of this dear treasure which we may not keep,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lord hath given, and he takes away,</div>
      <div class='line'>And still thy name with fervent blessings greet,—</div>
      <div class='line in10'>Thou who didst weep!</div>
      <div class='line in10'>Thou who didst weep!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The windows of the Basilica had all been darkened
and the lamps doubled; and to those standing
opposite the portal the two long rows of columns
and the climbing lights and upper glow might have
seemed like Jacob’s vision of the angelic stairway
stretching from earth to heaven, from shadow to
light.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hymn ended, they took up their dead and
went on in silence. The road that led to the cemetery
led nowhere else. It turned from the plain
at the south side of the Basilica, hidden by the elevation
of the little rock plateau on which the structure
was set, and passing along the side of it, entered
a deep and narrow ravine at the back. This
ravine was nearly half a mile long and walled with
precipitous rocks that shut out everything but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>line of sky above and the topmost point of one
white snow-peak, serene against the blue.</p>

<p class='c011'>Entering the ravine was to be reminded infallibly
of the “valley of the shadow of death.” Here
the prayers began. A single voice in the centre
of the procession exclaimed:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken
away,” and like waves the response rolled to front
and rear and back again,—“Blessed be the name
of the Lord!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Miserere was repeated in the same way, and
the Psalm “The Lord is my Shepherd.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun entered the ravine with them. There
was only one hour of the day when a direct beam
shone in, and that, except when the days were
longest, scarcely reached the foot-way. It shone
along over their heads now; and as the road near
its end made a turn further inward to the mountains,
it shone on a great golden legend set high
above on an arch springing from cliff to cliff:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>I am the Resurrection and the Life!</span></p>

<p class='c011'>Some men on the natural bridge that made the
archway stood outlined against the sky, looking
down at the procession. To them the gray robes
and black sashes could have been scarcely distinguishable
from the dark rocks; but the form of the
little maiden thus taking its last journey, and those
of the eight bearers, all in white, would shine out
of the shadows.</p>

<p class='c011'>No perfumed garden flowers grew on that high
land where they were working when they heard the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>bells’ <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">à morto</span></i>; but they gathered snowy daisies,
scentless and pure, and made a little drift of their
petals; and as the dead approached and passed
beneath, they dropped them down in a thin shower
as fine as any snow-crystals.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ravine opened beyond the arch to what had
been a torrent-bed circling round a cone-shaped
mountain almost destitute of verdure. The whole
mass of this mountain was a cemetery. Wide
stairs and galleries outside led to iron-bound doors
at different heights. One of these doors was open.
The procession, crossing a bridge over dry stones,
went up the graded ascent to what might be called
the second story. Here was a full sunshine. The
bearers set their burden down in it before the open
door. And here, at last, grief was allowed to have
its way for a moment. The mourners fell on their
knees beside their dead. A choir of men and
women broke out singing:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Look thy last upon the sun!</div>
      <div class='line'>Eyes that scarcely had begun</div>
      <div class='line'>To distinguish near from far,</div>
      <div class='line'>Star from lamp, or lamp from star;—</div>
      <div class='line'>Eyes whose bitterest tears were dew</div>
      <div class='line'>That a swift smile sparkled through.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lift thy white lids once, before</div>
      <div class='line'>Darkness seal them evermore!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Speak, and bid the air rejoice,</div>
      <div class='line'>Music of a childish voice!</div>
      <div class='line'>One more word our hearts shall hail</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweeter than the nightingale!</div>
      <div class='line'>Smile again, O lips of rose!</div>
      <div class='line'>Break the pitiless repose</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>That is builded like a wall</div>
      <div class='line'>Where in vain we beat and call.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Nevermore! Ah, nevermore!</div>
      <div class='line'>Till we touch the heavenly shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Voice or smile of hers shall bless</div>
      <div class='line'>Our heart-bleeding loneliness.</div>
      <div class='line'>Jesus, King, and Brother mild!</div>
      <div class='line'>Keep her yet a little child,</div>
      <div class='line'>That her face we there may see</div>
      <div class='line'>As we yield it back to thee!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The parents and the child’s brother sobbed as
they bent over the unanswering dead, if the peaceful
brightness of that flower-like face could be
called unresponsive, and they rose only when some
of their nearer friends bent over and would have
lifted them. Then the bearers took up the bier and
passed out of the sun, and disappeared into what
from the outside seemed a profound darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a long corridor formed precisely like a
catacomb, except that the greater part of it was
masonry. The roof, floor, and walls were all of
unpolished gray stone with white marble tablets set
in the walled-up niches. Three iron lamps suspended
from the ceiling threw all about a tender
golden light. At the farthest end of the corridor
something white reflected dimly. There were a
few closed niches, but the greater number of them
were unoccupied. Outside one of these, opposite
the second lamp, a smaller lamp, as yet unlighted,
was set in an iron ring fixed in the masonry.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bier was set down before this niche, which
was lined with myrtle sprigs, and had little lace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>bags filled with spices in the corners. There were
two silver rings inside attached to cords, one at the
head and one at the foot.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Tacita entered, she saw the father lift his
child and lay her in her fragrant bed, and the
mother place a pillow under her head. They
crossed her hands on her breast, and slipped one
of the silver rings on to a wrist and the other over
the slender foot. They had been weeping loudly;
but when, their service done, they stood and looked
at the peaceful and lovely sleeper, something of her
quiet came over them. They gazed fixedly, as if
their souls were groping after hers, or as if the wall
of her silence and immobility were not altogether
impenetrable, and intent, with hushed breathing,
they could catch some sense of a light fuller than
that of the sun, and of sweet sounds, beautiful scenes
and loving companionship in what had seemed a
void, and of nearness where infinite distances had
been straining at their heart-strings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita laid her bunch of white roses at the child’s
feet. Then Elena led her down the corridor and
pointed to a name inscribed on the marble of a
closed niche. It was her father’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>She kissed the marble, and stood thinking; then
turned away. “God keep him!” she said. “I
cannot find him here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the end of the corridor, in the centre of the
wall, was an open niche, all white marble, with a
gilded cross lying in it, and so many little bags of
spices that all the neighborhood was perfumed by
them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>This niche was called “The Resurrection;” and
at every funeral the mourners brought their tribute
of perfumes to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena drew her companion’s attention to the
niches around this open tomb. “You see how
small they are. They are all young infants. It
is the same in all the corridors. The end where
the tomb of Christ is, is called the cemetery of the
Innocents.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside, in the gallery, a choir was softly singing:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thou who didst weep!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“We will go now,” Elena whispered.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they went, the mourners still stood before
their dead, the husband and wife hand in hand.
The brother, with his hands clasped before him,
gazed steadfastly into his sister’s face, that was
scarcely whiter than his own.</p>

<p class='c011'>The little lamp had been lighted, the chains attached
to the chain of a bell hung outside the door,
and a plate of glass covered the niche.</p>

<p class='c011'>People came and went quietly. Some had gone
home; others were seated on the stone benches outside.
Dylar was leaning on the parapet; and when
Tacita and Elena came out, he accompanied them
down and through the ravine. When they reached
the lane behind the church, he asked Tacita if she
would like to go up and see his cottage, which was
just above the college. She assented gladly, and
Elena left them to go up the path together.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cottage was of the plainest, and contained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>but two rooms. The front one had a glass door
and two windows overlooking the town. There
was a table in the centre of the room with a revolving
top surrounded by drawers. A hammock hung
at the back, and there were two chairs, a bookcase
and a closet. The floor was of green and white
tiles, and the roughly plastered walls were washed
a dull green.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see, I have here everything that I need,”
Dylar said. “My living rooms are in the college;
but I often come here. My writing and planning,
especially of our outside affairs, is done here. The
business of San Salvador is all portioned out and
arranged, and can be done without me. But the
outside business requires a good deal of study.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He brought the chairs out, and they sat down,
and Dylar pointed out the larger mountains, and
named them, told where the torrents were and how
they had been or could be deviated, told where
the signal-stations were, and how they could know
from them all that happened at their outer stations.
He showed her her own chamber windows in the
Arcade, the heights behind which, scarcely hidden
from the town, she had entered San Salvador, and,
near the southeastern angle of the opening, a mountain
with a double peak, beyond which stood Castle
Dylar.</p>

<p class='c011'>The terrace where they sat was covered with a
thin dry turf, and a pine-tree grew at one side and
an olive-tree at the other. The olive was so old
that its trunk was quite hollowed out, and the side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>next the rock had long since died and been cut
away. The single great outward branch was full
of blossoms. From the parapet one could look
down and see the river of ripening wheat that
flowed quite round the rock on which the college
was built.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is the only spot in the world that I can
properly call home,” Dylar said. “It is the only
place all mine, and where no stranger comes. If
I am wanted, a signal calls me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You like to be here!” Tacita said with a certain
pensiveness. “You like to be alone!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You think so,” he said, “because I keep somewhat
apart. It is necessary that I should do so in
order to avoid complicating intimacies. Then, I
have a great deal to think of. Besides, I will confess
that when human affection comes too near, and
becomes personal, I feel a sense of recoil. Human
evil and sorrow I do not shrink from; but human
love”—</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita moved backward a step, and clouded over.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not so!” Dylar exclaimed. “It is precisely
because your friendship is as delicate as a mist that
I seek you, that I follow you. See that white
cloud on the pine-tree yonder! It is like you.
The tree-top, the topmost tree-top has caught and
tries to hold it. Do you think that it would like
to stay?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It stays!” she murmured; and a faint rose-hue
over her face and neck and hands betrayed the sudden
heart-throb. “It stays while it is held.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Dylar looked at her with delight in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad to have here at last the little girl of
the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">baiocco</span></i>,” he said. “I never forgot her. When
I no longer saw her, she grew up in my mind. I
fancied her saying to me across the world: ‘Why
do you not come? I am no longer a child!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita gave him a startled glance, and quickly
turned her eyes away. Love the most ardent, the
most impetuous, shone in his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tacita,” he said softly, “I am indeed a beggar
now! But do not fear. I will wait for your answer;
but I could not wait before letting you know
surely that my fate is in your hands. And now,
shall we go down?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned to descend before him, but stopped,
looking back over her shoulder with lowered eyes
that did not see his face. “May I have just one
little string of olive-blossoms?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>He gathered and gave it to her over the shoulder
her cheek was touching. “Ask me for the
tree!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let it be mine where it stands,” she said, hiding
a smile, and taking a step forward.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ask me for the castle!” he said passionately,
following her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will first see the castle,” she said, still going,
her face turned from him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you go to-morrow to see it? Elena will
accompany us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you ask me, I will go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They had reached the circle, and some men were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>there on their way to the upper gardens. In the
town they were alone again, and Dylar sketched
their programme for the next day.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You and Elena will talk it over,” he said.
“And if you wish any change made, send me word
this evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They parted at the door, and Tacita went upstairs
feeling as though she floated in the air.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The sun was not yet in the town. Its beams
had scarcely reached the Basilica in their progress
down the western mountains when the two ladies
mounted their donkeys at the Arcade to go to Castle
Dylar. The master of the castle was to meet
them on the mountain path above the college.</p>

<p class='c011'>They found him waiting for them; and as they
went up an easy serpentine road, and over bridges
binding cliff to cliff, Dylar pointed out hills and
streams where the small flocks and herds of San
Salvador were kept.</p>

<p class='c011'>From this path could be seen to the best advantage
the rock on which the college was built, and
the way the structure followed its outlines and imitated
them in pinnacles and terraces of every size
and shape. They found the mountains on which
the pine-woods bordered, and, close at hand, the
height from which the first Dylar had discovered
the site of his future city.</p>

<p class='c011'>San Salvador disappeared; then its gardens
were no longer visible; and then the spaces that
betrayed the presence of a plain, or valley, were
filled in; and they no longer looked backward.</p>

<p class='c011'>They entered upon a scene like that which had
preceded Tacita’s first vision of San Salvador,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>scarcely a month before; and again she began to
ask herself if it were not all a dream.</p>

<p class='c011'>But a word from Dylar was enough to chase the
phantom of unreality away. Tacita used every
pretext that enabled her to glance at him. He was
so picturesque and soldierly, he had such an uncommon
figure with his firm profile and auburn-tinted
hair; and the dark tunic and turban cap
with its silver band were so graceful.</p>

<p class='c011'>She and Elena had each a man at the bridle;
but Dylar was at her side at every rough place or
steep descent. Yet his manner could not be called
lover-like. It was rather that of a kind and anxious
guardian. She asked herself if he had indeed
said but the day before that his fate was in
her hands. It seemed impossible. It was he who
held her fate. Under his guardianship, how sweet
were the dark places, how welcome the giddy cliff
edges!</p>

<p class='c011'>Outwardly quiet, and with a face almost as colorless
as an orange flower, Tacita was intoxicated
with delight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the end of their journey, they passed across
the opening to a deep and dark ravine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There,” said the prince, pointing, “was found
the gold which enabled the first Dylar to buy and
cultivate land around the castle, and to found San
Salvador. It was a rich mine; and we still find a
few grains in it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A little later they reached a small plateau, and
dismounted. Passing a corner of ledge, they came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>to a long rough stair so shut in as to be in twilight.
It descended and disappeared in a turn,
and seemed to have been cut in the rock. It
ended at a door that opened into a low-roofed cave.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Courage!” said Dylar with a smile, and gave
his hand to Tacita.</p>

<p class='c011'>He led her through the cave, and up a stone
stair lighted by a hanging lamp to a landing that
had a narrow barred door at one side. Through
this door, masked on its other side by shelves, they
entered a large cellar such as one might expect to
find under an old castle founded upon rocks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here were long vistas of vaults supported on
piers of masonry, tracts of thick wall, both long
and short, sometimes taking the place of pillars and
arches. There were glistening rows of wine-hogsheads
diminishing in the darkness; and shelves of
jars gave a familiar domestic look to the place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dylar pointed out how cunningly the stair from
the cave below was hidden. It was set between
two walls that ran together like a wedge, a wall
starting off diagonally from the point where they
met, and pillars and arches so confusing the outlines
that the wedge-shape could not be suspected.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the large cellar they entered a small one
surrounded by shelves of bottles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sorry to welcome you to my house by
such a rough way,” Dylar said. “But it is, at
least, an ascending one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are giving me a charming adventure,”
Tacita said brightly. “I have entered many a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>palace and castle by the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">portone</span></i>, but never before
by a cavern and a masked door.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next stair led to a plainly-furnished study,
or office. Dylar hastened to open a door into a
noble baronial hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At last, welcome to Castle Dylar!” he exclaimed.
“May peace fill every hour you pass
within its walls. Command here as if all were
your own!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They entered a drawing-room of which the walls
were all a rich dimness of old frescos, and the
oaken furniture was upholstered with purple cloth.
The tall windows let in a brilliant sunshine
through the upper panes; but all the lower ones
were covered by shutters. Here the housekeeper
came to welcome the ladies and show them to their
chambers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wide stairway led to a circular gallery
hung with tapestries in which was woven the story
of Alexander the Great. There was nothing modern.
But the two connecting chambers they entered
were bright with sunshine, and fresh with
green and white draperies. The windows were
swathed with a thin gray gauze.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita went eagerly to look out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must not show ourselves,” Elena said.
“You can look through the gauze.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The first glance, vaulting over a mass of tree-tops
and a great half-moon of verdure, saw a plain that
extended to a low ripple of pale-blue mountains on
the horizon. A few stunted groves were visible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>on this wide expanse, and a few abrupt hills which
seemed to be protruding ledges, the crevices of
which had been gradually filled by the dust-bearing
winds.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita recollected Ion’s description of this
scene, which had appeared to him so beautiful that
San Salvador, compared with it, had seemed a
prison.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor boy!” she thought. “He will find nowhere
else such freedom as that which he is so
eager to leave.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The near view compensated by its richness for
the sterility of the distant. It was a vast fenceless
garden radiating two miles, or more, in every
direction from the front of the castle, and every
foot of it was cultivated to the utmost. There
were blocks of yellowing wheat, there was every
green of garden, orchard, and vineyard; and
through them all the ever-present olive-trees which
gave the place its name. They were planted
wherever a tree could go. Around the foot of the
castle they were clustered so thickly that they hid
even from its windows the green turf and gray
steps of its semicircular terraces. The large
houses of whitewashed stone with flat roofs were
scattered about irregularly. By some of them
stood groups of palm-trees; or a single tree waved
its foliage above the terrace.</p>

<p class='c011'>The visitors had their dinner in a quaint boudoir,
cone-shaped, and frescoed to look like a forest
aisle from the pavement to the apex of its ceiling.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>One could recognize the artist of the Basilica
in those interwoven branches, those leaping squirrels,
and the bird’s-nests with a gaping mouth or
downy head visible over the rim.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will give you a more fitting service when you
come here by way of the Pines,” Dylar said.
“But on these stolen visits from below we live
with closed doors and a single servant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He eats,” thought Tacita. “Therefore he is
human.” And she felt no need of puzzling over
a major proposition, nor, indeed, of anything but
what the painted cone contained.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It should be a communicable thought which
provokes that amused smile,” Dylar said when he
caught her expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita blushed. “I was telling myself that it
is a real plate of soup before you, and a real spoon
in your hand; and that therefore I need not expect
to find myself presently in the Madrid gallery,
and see you disappear into a picture-frame.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall I tell you something of that man’s history
by and by?” asked Dylar. “It may help to lay
his ghost.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes!” she exclaimed. “And, oh, yes!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When you shall have taken some repose,
then,” he said, “come with me to the terrace of
the tower. There, with the scene of my ancestor’s
labors before our eyes, I will show you how to distinguish
between him and me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot sleep, Elena,” said Tacita, when they
were alone. “Yet a nap is just what I want.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>What a shame it is that our rebellious bodies do
not know their duty better, and obey orders.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fancy,” said Elena, “that the body could retort
with very good reason when accused of being
troublesome, and that it understands and does its
business as well as the mind understands and does
its own. Why should not body and soul be
friendly comrades?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My respected friend and body,” said Tacita
with great politeness, as she leaned back in a deep
lounging-chair, “will you please to go to sleep?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She closed her eyes, and was silent a little
while, then opened them, and whispered, “Elena,
it won’t!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no reply. Elena had gone to sleep
in the adjoining chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita sat looking out over the wide landscape.
The nearest house visible over the olive-trees had
a flame of nasturtium flowers on its lower walls,
and a palm-tree lifting its columned trunk to hold
a plumy green umbrella over the roof. The foliage
waved languidly to and fro in a faint breeze,
lifting and falling to meet its own shadow that
lifted and fell responsive on the white walls and
gray roof. There was something mesmeric in the
motion; and the silence and “the strong sunshine
settled to its sleep” were like a steadfast will behind
the waving hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Tacita woke, Elena was waiting to tell
her that Dylar was in the drawing-room, and
would show her the castle.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>To one acquainted with old countries there was
nothing surprising in the massive, half-ruined
structure, with its rock foundations, and the impossibility
of finding one’s way unguided from one
part of the interior to the other. The ancient tapestries,
the stone floors with their faded rugs from
oriental looms, the stone stairways where a carpet
would have looked out of place, and was, in fact,
spread only as flowers are scattered for some <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">festa</span></i>,—they
were not strange to Tacita. But they were
most interesting.</p>

<p class='c011'>A round tower made the centre of the castle;
and there was a wing at either side with a labyrinth
of chambers. This tower formed a rude
porter’s lodge on the ground, a fine hall above, a
gallery by the sleeping-rooms, and the fourth floor
was Dylar’s private study. From this room a
narrow stair went up through the thickness of the
wall to the roof terrace. There were secret passages,
and loop-holes for observation everywhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God knows how many deeds of darkness these
hidden chambers may have witnessed!” Dylar said.
“If it had not seemed possible that they may be
useful in the future, some of them would have
been torn down before this. If any large agricultural
work were attempted, it might be necessary
to lodge the workmen here for a while. When
these houses you see were being built, a hundred
men dined every day in a hall in the eastern wing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They had stepped out on to the terrace, where
chairs had been placed for them, screened from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>sight by the parapet, so that as they sat only a
green and gold rim of the settlement was visible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How beautiful it would be,” said Tacita, “if
all that plain were wheat and corn and vines and
orchards, with the hills crowned with small separate
cities, all stone, with not a green leaf, only
boxes of pinks outside the windows.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just my thought!” Dylar exclaimed, blushing
with pleasure. “Who knows but it may be some
day? We own some land outside our farms, and
have begun by planting it with canes. It is that
unbroken green band you see yonder. It is larger
than it looks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were silent a little while. There was no
word that could have added to their happiness.
Then the prince began his story.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Three hundred years ago the name of Dylar
was well known in some of the great cities of
Europe and the East. The family had occupied
high places, and the head of it at that time, whose
portrait you have seen, was a brave soldier. He
was fortunate in everything,—too fortunate, for
he excited envy. He had a beautiful wife and a
young son and a daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His wife died, and with her departed his good
fortune. While he mourned for her, forgetful of
everything but grief, those who envied him were
busy. I need not enter into details. His life is
all recorded, and you can read it if you will. It
is enough to say that his enemies succeeded in depriving
him of place, and in multiplying their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>number. They changed the whole face of the
earth for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He found himself in that position where a man
sees open before him the abyss of human meanness.
Trivial minds dropped off their childish
graces and showed their childish brutality. Nothing
is capable of a greater brutishness than a
trifler. Fine sentiments came slipping down like
gorgeous robes from dry skeletons. Prudence took
the place of magnanimity, its weazened face as
cold as stone. Ceremonious courtesy met him
where effusive affection had been. In short, he
had the experience of a man who has lost place and
power with no prospect of regaining them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He had no wish to regain them, and would
have refused them had they been offered. To astonishment,
incredulity, and indignation succeeded
a profound disgust. His only wish was to shake
off all his former associations, and seek a place
where he might forget them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He sold his property, and with his two children
abandoned a society that was not worthy of
him. A nurse and a man-servant only clung to
his fortunes, and refused to be separated from him
and his children.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For a time he was a wanderer, thinking many
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He had been noble and honorable, but not religious.
It is probable that now, when humanity
had so failed him, he raised his eyes to inquire of
that Deity of whose existence he had formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>made only a respectful acknowledgment. The
Madrid picture must have been painted about this
time. It expresses his state of mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Doubtless some of the plans which he afterward
put in execution were already floating in his
imagination when in one of his journeys he came
upon this place, for he immediately resolved to purchase
it. It is recorded that he exclaimed, ‘It was
made for me!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The place must have looked uninviting at that
time to one who had not already plans which would
make works of improvement a welcome necessity;
for what is now a garden was then a waste almost
as barren as that you see beyond; and in place of
these houses, which, in a rustic way, are fine,
noble structures, were a few miserable huts inhabited
by tenants as ignorant, and even vicious, as
they were poor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Probably Dylar had that feeling from the first
which has been ever since one of our principles of
action, to take the worst, that which no one else
would take, in men and things, and work at their
reformation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At all events, he set out at once to find the
owner of the place, a young man who might be in
Paris, or London, or Rome, but most surely, at the
gaming-table. Found at last, after a long search,
he consented readily to sell, but he did not consent
gladly. He could not hesitate, for he was reduced
almost to living by his wits; but he suffered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dylar had compassion on him. He saw in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>him the victim of an evil education involved in a
life from which he was too weak to escape. But
it was impossible to approach such a man with the
same help which he could give to others. He only
begged that if ever the young man, or his children,
should wish to live in retirement for a while,
they would still look upon the castle of their ancestors
as a home to which they would be ever
welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then he set himself to change the face of his
desolate possessions. He gathered a score of outcasts,
men and women to whom every door of hope
was closed, and brought them to the castle till
other shelter could be provided for them. More
than one of them had crimes to confess; but they
were the crimes of misery and desperation rather
than of malice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of a different class of the needy, he added to
his own household. There was an elderly lady
who gladly took the place of duenna to his daughter;
and an old book-worm who was starving in unhonored
obscurity became his son’s tutor, and later
an important agent in the success of his plans.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course, agriculture was their first need;
and the tutor was far in advance of his time in
this science—so far as to have been considered a
visionary. Dylar found him able to realize these
visions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Before long, the land began to reward them.
Huts had been built for the new-comers, and all
worked with a will. Dylar had confided something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of his plans to these poor people, and had inspired
them with an ambition to build here a city of refuge,
and to look forward to a time when they
might say to the world which had condemned them,
Behold! a higher judge has absolved us.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whether the thought occurred first to Dylar,
or to his son’s tutor, we do not know; but they
agreed that gold must exist in large quantities in
the mountains, and they secretly searched for it.
Some grains had been found in a little stream that
issued from the mountains where the river now is.
To guess how difficult it was to get at the source
of this stream you would have to examine the conformation
of the mountains about the castle. In
fact, they were reduced to the necessity of descending
inside by ropes from the castle itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You understand that they succeeded, and found
gold in large quantities. You will also understand
that they must have confided their secret to
others.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here was an immense difficulty. Had this
discovery been made known to his people, Dylar’s
community would have been ruined, his plans overset
forever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He hit upon a device. He made another visit
to the outside world, and brought back seven men
who might be called desperate criminals. He
asked them to work for him five years, separated
from the world, with no other companionship than
their own, and, the term expired, to go far away
taking oath never to divulge what they had seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and done. On his side, he would provide for all
their needs, and give them a sum of money which
to them would be riches.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They agreed readily, not doubting but they
were wanted to commit some crime. When the
term of their service was ended, they were no
longer criminals; and among their descendants have
been the most faithful guardians of San Salvador.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These men lived at first in a cave in the ravine.
Then they built them huts. Later, wives
were found for them, and they made homes for
themselves. Long before the five years were
ended the plain of San Salvador was discovered,
the city planned, and the lower entrance to the
castle begun. Outside, land was purchased and
cultivated, and the houses which preceded the present
ones were built. Many new people had been
brought in, and some sent out to study a handicraft
or science. Building and agriculture were the
chief studies of the people.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will see that the story can only be touched
here and there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everything succeeded, because all were in
sympathy with their leader, and his prosperity was
their prosperity. These men and women who had
found themselves here, perhaps, for the first time
in their lives, treated with respect, had no desire
to withdraw the veil so mercifully let down between
their human present and their infernal past.
They were faithful from self-interest and from a
passionate sense of gratitude.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Now and then a new-comer was hard to assimilate;
but indulgence was shown. A mind long
embittered may almost outgrow the possibility of
peace, not from any deformity of character, but
from a profound sense of injustice. A man or
woman of middle age who can remember no happy
childhood, no aspiration of enthusiastic youth which
was not crushed by disappointment and mortification,
has amassed a sense of wrong which help
comes too late then to cancel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dylar’s conviction, which still holds with us,
was that a person so unfortunate as to have become
an outcast from civilization is most probably the
victim of some atrocious wrong in his birth, or in
his early training, or that some supreme injustice
has been done him later in life. Enlightened by
his own experience and by subsequent observation,
he perceived a wide and cruel barbarism hidden
beneath the fair semblance of what calls itself civilization.
Christianity he recognized as the only
true civilizer; but Christianity was an individual,
not a social fact. There was no Christian society.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As time passed, some persons of a different
character, though all needy, began to be drawn
into the Olives,—a mourner who desired to spend
the remnant of a blighted life in retirement, or a
hopeless invalid, or some student whose life was
consecrated to study and starvation. He was astonished
to find how many accomplished people in
the world were poor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was, therefore, in no want of teachers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Some remained for a time; some never left him.
To the latter only the existence of San Salvador
was known.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the lifetime of the first Dylar the necessity
for preparing for outside colonies was already felt,
and his successor began them. He made large investments,
and had agents. All young orphans
were sent out, and all beyond a certain number in
families. Sometimes a whole family will go. Their
relatives are their hostages.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was the third Dylar, called Basil, who built
the Basilica. There had been only a shrine for a
throne of acacia wood. This throne Basil made
with his own hands. It was he also who planned
and began the cemetery; and he was the first one
to be laid in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Basil went out young into the world. He
made himself first a carpenter, then studied architecture
and mining. He never married. I am descended
from his brother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Volumes might be filled with beautiful stories
that were told of him, and with legends, half true,
half false, which the people wove about him. His
sudden appearances and disappearances at the
castle after he returned to San Salvador were held
by some to be miraculous. He lived a hundred
years, and was found dead on the summit of the
mountain of the cemetery. There is a grassy
hollow at the top that is called ‘Basil’s Rest.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would be worth your while to go there some
morning before sunrise, to hear the larks. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>story of his finding there, and of the people bringing
his body down, is like a song.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The first and second Dylars called the unfortunates
they brought here ‘children of Despair.’
Basil named those he brought ‘children of Hope’!</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have told you that the first Dylar made
friendly offers and promises to the man of whom
he bought this castle. His acts were in conformity
with his words. He kept a watch over the
family, especially after he had discovered gold.
He held himself more solemnly bound to them by
that discovery. When any one of them was in
difficulty, he went to the rescue. But it was long
before one of them was admitted to San Salvador.
Then a widow came with her young infant. This
widow married the fourth Dylar. From the little
girl, her daughter, Iona and Ion are descended.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” exclaimed Tacita. “Iona!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Iona! In her and her brother alone we
recognize now the blood of the original possessors
of Castle Dylar. Their presence here satisfies our
sense of justice. The girl I speak of married in
San Salvador, and she and her husband went out
to have the charge of our affairs in France. One
of their sons became a messenger, that is, a person
who keeps a regular communication between all
the children of San Salvador, reports births and
deaths, carries verbal messages, and does whatever
business may be necessary in his province. It is
a messenger who buys and brings all our supplies
and carries out all our produce.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“The son of this messenger became himself a
messenger. He was Iona’s grandfather. He was
named Zara for a Greek friend of the family. He
was restless and adventurous, like all his race. He
went to the East. This was in the time of my
grandfather. He married an Arab woman—ran
away with her, indeed. But the circumstances of
the escapade were such as to render it pardonable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He lived but a short time after this marriage,
and his widow with her only child, afterward
Iona’s mother, came to San Salvador. Iona’s
father was a relative of mine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What Iona is I need not tell you; for you
know her. She is one of Nature’s queens, and of
the rarest; and Ion is worthy to be her brother.
In both that restless fire of him who, for very impatience,
sacrificed his birthright is intensified by
this spark from Araby. But they have reason and
discipline, and will have opportunity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am telling you too long and dull a story.
But having these outlines, you may afterward take
pleasure in learning many details of our history.
It is full of romantic adventure and Christian heroism.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have I wearied you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So far from it,” Tacita said, “that I would
gladly listen longer. But you also may be weary.
Tell me, these details of your history, are they all
written?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not all. The simple facts are all written.
Our archives are perfect. The rest is left to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>memory of the people. We write no books of adventure,
and no novels; but we talk them; and our
story-tellers are as inexhaustible as Scheherezade.
You have not yet listened to one of them, though
you may have seen an audience gathered about one
in the booths above the Arcade. There is one
whom I must soon take you to hear. He is a gardener,
and understands more about olives and the
making of oil than any other man in San Salvador.
His story-telling is picturesque and poetical.
He does not change the facts, but he transfigures
them. His mind has a golden atmosphere.
There is another, a baker, who will tell you stories
as lurid as the fires that heat his ovens. One
of the elders sometimes tells stories of heroic virtue
in our pioneers, or in historical characters of
the world. When our messengers come in, they
always give a public account, sometimes very prosaic,
of their travels.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Has there never been a traitor in San Salvador?”
Tacita asked timidly, fearing to awaken
some painful recollection.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never!” was the prompt reply. “In the first
place, even of persons born here of our most
highly-honored citizens, but sent out very young,
no one can know that such a place exists till he has
returned to it. This is your own case. Those
who go out adults are persons who have been tried.
Any notable wealth or luxury of living is forbidden,
or discouraged, in our people; and having
thus nothing which will attract flatterers, they see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the world more nearly as it is. Self-interest helps.
Besides, with the training our children have, no
Judas can come out of San Salvador. We will
have no weak mothers here. If a young child
shows vicious dispositions, it is taken from its
mother and carried outside for training. Perhaps
it may never return.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She cannot go with it?” Tacita asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She cannot go. Did she give birth to an immortal
creature for her own amusement in seeing
it ruining itself and others? I do not speak of
any mere infirmity of temper in the child, but of
some dishonest propensity which persists.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita bethought her to speak of Ion’s affairs,
as she had promised; and after discussing the subject
awhile, they went down through darkening
stairs and passages to where supper awaited them,
set out in an illuminated corner of the great hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had supper here that you might see the castle
shadows,” Dylar said. “Seen from our little
lighted corner, all this space seems to be crowded
with dusky shapes. Do you see?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>They returned to San Salvador the next day.
The sun had set when they reached the town, and
the streets were full. Elena and Dylar dismounted
at the college; but Dylar insisted that
Tacita should ride to the Arcade, and he walked
there by her side. She made her little progress
with a blushing modesty, ashamed of being the
only person in town who was not on foot.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the door of the Arcade Dylar took leave.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sure that you will not go to the assembly
this evening,” he said, “and I shall not go. Rest
yourself well, and to-morrow I will take you to
hear one of our story-tellers. To-night I—I want
to remember!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He murmured the words lowly as he lifted her
from the saddle, and she answered them with a little
half sigh. She also wanted to remember.</p>

<p class='c011'>Supper was over; and she and Elena had theirs
alone in the dining-room, talking quietly over their
journey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are happy, child?” Elena asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never dreamed of being so happy!” Tacita
answered. And they looked into each other’s eyes,
and understood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Going to the salon, they found Iona waiting
there.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“I suppose that you are not going to the assembly
to-night,” she said. “But I hope that
you are not too tired to tell me how you like the
Olives.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The little glimpse I was allowed was charming.
I never saw such verdure. The foliage, the fruit,
were in billows, in drifts, in heaps. And how
I longed to go to one of those great white houses,
and sit on the roof under the palm-shadows. I
said to the prince, ‘Why have we no palms in San
Salvador?’ and he is going to have some. I thought
of the Basilica as a proper site; but he doubted a
little. It is not decided. He said, we worship
Christ as King, and shrink from holding the impious
insult of his martyrdom forever before his
eyes. And the palm is for the martyr. But the
palms will grow somewhere, and will be my special
garden; and the first person who dies in the effort
to serve or save San Salvador shall be carried to
his grave with a waving of palm branches, and a
song of hosannas, and a palm-leaf shall be entombed
with him, and one cut in the marble that
bears his name. For that, I would almost wish to
die a martyr.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For that?” said Iona coldly. “The martyr,
I fancy, is not thinking of the crown when he
throws his life into the breach.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was thinking of the people’s love,” said
Tacita, faltering, her eyes cast down to hide the
tears that started. She was so happy that she
could not bear a check. Her heart had unclosed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>itself without a thought, a fear, and it shrank at
the little icy breath of Iona’s answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why do not you ask me how I like your
castle?” she said, recovering herself quickly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My castle?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; the prince told me the story.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is very true that the original owner would
never have sold his castle if he had known that
there was a mine of gold within a stone’s throw of
it,” Iona said. “But neither did the purchaser
know. All was done in honor; and the Dylar
have spent time, thought, and money, in compensating
my family. I do not hold that I have
a shadow of a claim; yet if I should to-day ask
Dylar for a house and an independent competence
outside, I should have it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita had already felt more than once that,
however welcome her presence might be to every
one else in San Salvador, Iona regarded it with a
feeling that could scarcely be called by any warmer
name than indifference. To-night her manner was
more than usually stately, though she talked as
much as ever, was, in fact, rather more voluble
than her wont. But her talk was like an intrenchment
behind which her real self was withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently she began to question Tacita concerning
her first journey to San Salvador, and especially
that part of it made in the company of Dylar.
Where had she first met him? Had she seen
much of him? Were they long in Madrid together?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Surprised, Tacita answered with what frankness
she could, and tried not to feel offended. She
said nothing of the hymn under their balcony in
Venice, nor of the picture in the Madrid gallery.
The details of the rest were meagre enough. She
had not realized how little there was to tell when
the story was divested of those glances, tones, and
movements which in her imagination filled out the
gracious and perfect memory. Those few facts had
been to her like the pale and scattered stars of a
constellation which to the mind’s eye vivify all the
blue air between. She tried to think that in the
freedom and confidence of this life such questions
were not intrusive, and that Iona, from her position,
had a peculiar interest, and even right, in
knowing all that concerned Castle Dylar and its
master. But in spite of her self-exhortation a
troubled thought would come. Could it be possible
that Iona would set herself against her friendship
with Dylar? Did she suspect anything more
than an ordinary friendship between them?</p>

<p class='c011'>Their conversation grew dry, and Iona rose to
retire, with a leave-taking which could have been
kinder, but not more elaborately polite. Looking
out, Tacita saw her go toward the assembly-rooms,
and was glad to remember that Dylar would not
be there. It was twilight, and at the highest point
of the college she saw his light shine out like a
beacon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seeing that light made her forget everything
else.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“Perhaps he will look for my light,” she thought,
and drew her curtain quickly, and lighted a lamp.
“I wonder if he will look!” Blushing, she passed
slowly between the curtain and the light, then
covered her face with her hands, ashamed of herself
as if she had committed a sin. “I hope that
he didn’t see me!” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon after she extinguished her lamp, and sat
down by the open window. At that hour of early
evening San Salvador was as gay and crowded as
it was silent and deserted in the morning. There
was a sound of violins from the Star-house; and underneath
her window two girls were dancing, trying
to keep time to the music that was smothered
by the sound of their steps. There was a murmur
of talk from some of the near housetops, and the
voice of a child singing itself to sleep. Leaning
out the window, she could see a little farther up
the road an open lighted booth where two men sat
playing chess with a group of men and women
watching the game. An old man wearing a scarlet
fez sat close beside the players, intent on the game.
The light on their faces made them look golden,
and the fez was like a ruby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How beautiful it is! And how happy I am!”
murmured Tacita.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The next evening Dylar came for Tacita and
her friend to go with him and hear a recitation of
one of their story-tellers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The place was a nook of the ravine leading to the
kitchens, and was so completely shut in by high
rocks as to be quite secluded.</p>

<p class='c011'>An irregular circle capable of admitting fifty persons
had a shoal alcove at one side, and all around
it low benches on which were laid thick straw mats
stuffed with moss. In the alcove was a chair; and
an olive-oil lamp of four flames was set in a niche
of the rock above. These flames threw a strong,
rich light on a score or two of men and women in
the circle, their faces shining out like medallions;
but they touched the man who sat in the chair only
in some fugitive line on his hair, or cheek, as he
moved. His form was scarcely defined. He sat
there, a shadow, with his face bowed into his
hands, splashes of black and of gold all about him.
He seemed to be waiting, and Dylar spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here is one who waits to hear for the first time
how Basil of the Dylar lived and died.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At that voice the story-teller lifted his face,
rose, and having bowed lowly, resumed his seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did Basil of the Dylar live and die!” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>exclaimed. “Ask of the poor and the sorrowing
how he lived. Ask of the men and women who
stood at bay, facing a stupid and dastardly world.
Ask, and they will answer you: ‘He was a dove
and a lion,—a dove to our hidden sorrow, a lion in
our defense.’ Ask of the heart bowed down with
a sense of guilt so heavy it fain would hide in the
night, and follow it round the world; fly from the
light, and hide in the night forever around the
world. They will say, ‘Has the Christ come back?
Can a mercy so overflowing be found in a human
soul?’ Ask of the children who clung to him
when he stood white in the gloaming. He was
white, his hair and heard; his face and his robe,
they were white.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The children coming from school cried out
when they saw, and ran to him. They ran, they
flew, they clung around him like bees or butterflies,
joyous. They held the folds of his robe. They
pressed to hold his hand, and kissed it finger by
finger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He lifted and tossed the smallest. ‘Reach up
to heaven,’ he said, ‘and pull me down a blessing.
Stretch your innocent hands and gather it like a
star-blossom.’ And then would the little one, all
wide-eyed, reach up and wait till he said, ‘It is
done!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘How did the King come down?’ they asked
him. ‘How was God made man?’ He answered
them: ‘The sweetness of the Godhead dropped
like honey from a flower. The brightness of the
Godhead fell like a star-beam from a star.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“And he would say to them: ‘Ask of your angels
how God looks. How does he smile and
speak? For your angels, said the King’s Majesty,
ever behold his face. Mine has followed me out
into a century’s shadows, walked with me out
through a century’s falling leaves. But ask your
angels to-night to whisper close to your pillow, or
come in a dream and tell you what are his hair
and eyes, his voice and his smile. Ask one time
and ten times. Ask ten times and a thousand.
Ask again till they answer, “His face I behold no
longer; for you are no longer a child.”’</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then their mothers would hear them at
night whispering on their pillows.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did he die, our prince? How at last did
we lose him?</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was a thought that hovered, dove-like,
over the people, that Basil would stay till his coming,
stay till the coming of Christ. It hovered,
coming and going, but never alighted in speech.
Quieter grown, but hale, he lived to a hundred years,
lived in the midst of his people, going no more
abroad. He sat in the sun, or the shadow, judged,
and counseled, and pardoned, peacemaking, scattering
blessings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But when, of the hundred years, the last few
sands were sifting, he girded him for a journey,
and climbed the southern hills. After a week, returning,
‘I bring you a message,’ he said, ‘from
our ancient Mother, the Earth.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“He showed them a grain of gold as it comes up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>out of the mine, set in the gray and white of a rock
with clay in the crevices pressed. Pure and
sparkling it lay in its crude and worthless bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Said Basil, ‘What pay you for bread? Is it
dust? And for raiment, a crumbling stone? For
house and land, and a gift of love, do you offer
dust alone? A careless kiss is easy to give, and
a careless word to say. Will you fling your dust
in the face of God? You have gold in your hearts,
my children. Cast your follies away like dust, and
break your pride like a stone. Dig for your gold,
my children, says Earth, your Mother. Deep in
your hearts it lies hidden.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“That gold that he brought is set at the foot of
the throne, and the words that he spoke there engraven:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Dig for your gold, my children, says Earth,
your Mother. Deep in your hearts it lies hidden.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“He went to every house. Not a threshold but
felt his footsteps. Children passed by him in line
for a touch of his hand, and old men knelt for his
blessing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He went to the house of the King, and walked
with his head bent lowly, walked to and fro in the
rough new building, saying never a word. But,
standing without, he cried: ‘My heart for a step
at the door! and my soul for a lamp at the footstool!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“He entered the dark ravine, he and the sun together.
He was led by the hand by a sunbeam
over the stony way. He went to the place he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>set for the dead, where as yet no dead were sleeping.
What he did, what he said thenceforth, no
creature knoweth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Basil, our prince, and the sun went to the ravine
together. The sun went in and came out; but
Basil, our father, lingered. Twilight settled and
deepened; but Basil, the White Father, came not.
The stars came out in the night; the people gathered
and waited. They whispered there in the
dark, and dared not search, nor question. They
whispered and waited and wept: ‘We shall nevermore
behold him! He has bidden us all farewell,
and gone from our sight forever!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“But at the dawn they said: Awake! Let us find
him! Nor food nor drink shall be ours till we
know where his foot has faltered. Homes we have
none till Basil, our father, is found!</p>

<p class='c011'>“The light was faint in the east; they could see
but their own pale faces. They entered, a crowd,
the ravine; they covered its stones like a torrent!
Praying and weeping they went, but softly, not to
disturb him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They reached the Mountain of Sleep that he
had chosen to rest in. Only one hall was finished,
one bed made smooth for slumber. Basil, the
prince, was not there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But a lark sprang up outside, springing and
soaring upward. They followed his song and his
flight; for he seemed heaven’s messenger to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They climbed the rough, steep rock; they wept
no more, but they panted. Wide and bright were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>their eyes with a solemn and high premonition.
They climbed to a verdant spot like an oasis in the
granite.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, like a fountain of song, jetting and
singing upward, climbing from song to song, the
larks were bursting and soaring out of the thick
fine grass all over-floated with blossoms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And, lo! a beam of the sun shot over the eastern
mountains, touched the grass where he lay,
and seemed to say, Behold him! And beam after
beam shot over, seeming to say, We have found
him! while the larks sang pæans of joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The people gathered around, and silently knelt
in a circle; knelt, and folded their hands, but wept
not, spoke not, prayed not. Silent they gazed and
listened, as though on the threshold of heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There he lay, all white, in the hollow top of
the mountain, straight and peaceful and fair, his
hands crossed on his bosom. All white, save an
azure glimmer seen ’twixt the snowy eyelids, he lay
in the deep soft grass with the lark-choir singing
about him,—singing as if they saw the dawn of
the Resurrection.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As they looked, his silvery whiteness grew
bright in the sun of the morning. Would he melt
like frost, and exhale! Would he rise like a cloud
on the sunbeams!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thus stayed they an hour, the living as mute
as the dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then one, not turning his eyes, spoke lowly:
‘He moves not, neither to rise and speak, as we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>knew him; nor moves he to float away and be lost
in the air of the morning. Passive he lies, our
prince, in a sweet obedience to death. Passive and
humble he lies, obeying the law of our Maker.
Is it not then that he waits for his people to bear
him downward where he has hollowed his bed, to his
resting-place in the shadows?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then said another lowly, his eyes still fixed
on the dead: ‘Send we messengers down to bring
what is meet to bear him. And bring the children
to walk closest of all beside him. For their angels
see the face of the Heavenly Father.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then he looked in their faces, and said: ‘We
are fainting with thirst and hunger. For a night
and a day we have fasted and grieved and searched.
Let the strong among us bring bread and meat and
a litter. I, who am strong, will go.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“So they went down, half a hundred, and
brought a litter well woven, hung on staves of ash
wood strong and long and polished. They brought
up meat and drink; and the children, wondering,
followed, knowing not what death is, not being let
to know. They gathered about him softly, seated
themselves in the grasses, decked their heads with
the flowers. And in the folded hands and on the
pulseless bosom of Basil they warily slipped sweet
blossoms of white and blue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the elders whispered them: ‘Hush! he is
sleeping! Hush! he is weary!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then the people sat in a circle, and ate and
drank in silence, prayerful, as if they ate the Holy
Bread of the altar. Ending, they rose and gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>thanks; and tender and reverent, laid their dead
on the litter, and took the staves on their shoulders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The children, wondering, ran, lifting questioning
eyes, puzzled, but no wise grieving, and clung
to the edge of the litter.  They were close to his
head and his feet, they pressed inside of the bearers,
making a flowery wreath all fluttering round
his whiteness.  And where a fold of his garment
wavered over the border, a dozen dimpled hands
proudly bore it along.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So they went down the mountain, weeping, but
not with sorrow.  For they felt a stir within them,
a trembling, an unfolding, a lifting sense in the
temples, a glimmering sense of kindred to clouds
where the sun is calling the rainbow out of the rain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was a woman among them, a singer of
songs.  Basil had named her the Lark of San Salvador.
As they went down, she made a song and
sang it; and to this day the song is sung by all the
scattered children of San Salvador.  Later times
have added penitence and supplication to the one
stanza that she sang to them that day.  Our hymn
suits the dark hours of life: hers was all victory
and exultation.  She sang:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘San Salvador, San Salvador,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>We live in thee!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“While she sang, they laid him in the bed that
he had chosen.  And when Dylar, the heir, came
home to them, ‘You have done well!’ he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Behold!  Thus lived and died Prince Basil,
the White Father of San Salvador!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>About a week after, one day when their lesson
was ended, Iona said: “I have seen Dylar to-day,
and he proposed that I should make a visit with
you. Professor Pearlstein, whose class of boys you
will recollect, would have come to see you, but he
is quite lame. He sprained his ankle some time
ago, and cannot yet walk much. He knew Professor
Mora well. They were boys together.
Would you like to go up?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita assented eagerly, and they set out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are going to see an admirable person,”
Iona said as they went along. “He is very useful
to the community. He sets the boys thinking,
and guides their thoughts, but not so severely as to
check their expression. He especially urges them
to study what he calls the Scriptures of nature.
He keeps the records of the town, and in the most
perfect way, knowing how to select what is worth
recording. He will make no comment. His idea is
that most histories have too much of the historian
in them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My grandfather had the same opinion,” Tacita
said. “He held that the province of an historian
is to collect as many authentic facts as possible,
and present them, leaving the reader to draw his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>own conclusions. He did not thank the historian
for telling him that a man was good or was wicked
from his own conclusion, giving no proof. He
preferred to decide for himself from the given facts
whether to admire or condemn the man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They reached the path leading upward; and
there Iona stopped. She was very pale.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you mind going up alone?” she asked.
“I do not feel quite well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita anxiously offered assistance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona turned away somewhat abruptly. “I need
nothing, thank you. Go in peace, since you are
willing. I am sure that you would have much
more pleasure in a tête-à-tête conversation with
Professor Pearlstein. Present my salutations.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita, feeling herself decidedly rejected, looked
after her a moment. Iona was evidently neither
weak nor faint. She walked rapidly, and, instead
of going homeward, had followed the outer road
northward.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Professor was seated in his little terrace
with a table beside him. He was weaving a basket.
Silvery white roots in assorted bunches were
piled on the table, and strips of basket-wood lay
on the ground in coils. His robe was of gray cloth
with a white girdle and hood, and he wore a little
scarlet skull-cap. Tacita saw now, better than before,
how handsome he was. The face was strong
and placid, the hands fine in shape, the hair
gleamed like frost.</p>

<p class='c011'>She stood on the edge of the terrace before he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>saw her, and was in some trepidation lest she had
not taken pains enough to make him aware of her
approach.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he looked up suddenly, secretly aware of
some other human presence, his face lighted with
a smile of perfect welcome, and with a faint, delicate
blush.</p>

<p class='c011'>He brought out a pretty chair of woven roots
with leathern cushions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The terrace is my salon,” he said. “And I
have the pleasure of asking you to be the first to
sit in a chair of my own making. Are not the
roots pretty? See the little green stripe running
through the silver. It is second sight, already
dreaming of leaves. Till I began basket-making,
I had not known the beautiful colors and textures
of woods. It is a pleasant employment for my
hands. It enables me to think while working. Is
the chair right for you? I am grateful to you for
coming up. Shall we continue to speak in Italian?
It must come more readily to you; and I
am always pleased to speak the beautiful language.
It is not more musical than San Salvadorian; but
it is richer. Our language grows slowly. It is
limited, like the experience of our people. Every
new word, moreover, is challenged, and tried by a
jury of scholars. We adopt a good many imitative
words, especially from the Italian. You will
hear <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">fruscio</span></i>, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ciocie</span></i>, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">rimbomba</span></i>, and the like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They spoke of Professor Mora, and Tacita answered
a good many questions concerning him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Professor Pearlstein, in return, recalled their
early days together; and she found it delightful to
hear of her grandfather as a boy, leaping from
such a rock, picking grapes in vintage time in the
road below, studying in the college yonder, and
sliding down from terrace to terrace on a rope. It
was charming, too, to hear of her mother as a little
girl, quaint and serious, with golden hair and
a pearly skin, and of her father as master of the
orchards, with eyes like an eagle, and a ready,
musical laugh. He died from a fall in trying to
jump from one tree to another. “Who would
have thought,” he said, “that it is only three feet
from time to eternity!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad,” Professor Pearlstein said, “that
my old friend was able to live his own life to the
last. It is not so hard for a student such as he.
In such cases people can understand that they do
not understand, and they let the student alone.
In going out into the world, the most of us feel the
pressure of a thousand petty restraints. I reckon
that I lost five years of my life in wondering what
people would think of things which they had no
right to notice at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is like a person trying to run in a sack,”
Tacita said, “or like rowing against the tide a
gondola all clogged and covered with weeds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man brought a little table and placed
on it a dainty refreshment for his visitor, setting
it out with a pleased, hospitable care: a slice of
bread, a conserve of orange-flowers, and a tiny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>glass of wine; partaking also with her at her request.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I always expected some great discovery from
Professor Mora,” he said, folding his arms and
looking far away to the western mountains. “At
first I thought that it would be in physics. But I
soon found that he looked through, rather than at,
natural objects and phenomena. Visible nature
was to him the screen which hid the object of his
search. I recollect walking home with him one
day in Paris after we had listened to a lecture on
electricity from a famous scientist. ‘What does
electricity mean?’ your grandfather exclaimed.
He held that the greatest obstacle to the discovery
of truth is the insincerity of man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I liked the same studies that interested him,
though my proficiency in them was small; and
when I saw the way he went, I hoped that he
would set the seal of his guess, at least, on some
grand eclectic plan of creation toward which my
lighter fancy spun blindly its filmy threads.
That terrible ‘I do not know’ of his was crushing!
But later I learned to be thankful for one man
who searched far into psychical and theological
problems, yet spared the race a new theory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita listened with pleasure to his dreamy talk.
And she told him of the recitation she had heard
the week before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That flowery nook, with its larks, is to-day
what it was when Basil laid him down there to
die,” he said. “The mountain is excavated in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>halls that concentrate like the spokes of a wheel,
with a column left solid in the centre. The hollow
called Basil’s Rest may be called the upper hub.
The lower one is in the centre of the earth.
There’s a narrow stair goes up on the outside.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When Tacita went down, she saw Iona coming
toward her, seemingly quite restored to health.
Her cheeks were crimson, her eyes sparkling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I feel better,” she said. “Let us go to the
Star-terrace for a view of the sunset.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They went, and she pointed out effects of shadow
in the western mountains and of colors in the eastern.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have sometimes an impulse to go out into the
world again,” she said then, abruptly. “When I
was there, it was during my silence. I was there
to study, not to talk. When we first go out, especially
the young, we are held to a period of
silence as to decisions, opinions, wishes, and plans.
Obeying, we save ourselves trouble and avoid a
good deal of foolishness. The story of Sisyphus
is impressed on us as that of one whose first years
are spent in a foolish effort and his last years in
repenting of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The only opinion we express from the first and
at all ages is that touching our faith. A child
may reprove a blasphemer, or assert its devotion
to Christ in the hearing of one who expresses doubt.
One subject after another is freed for us, as we
learn what the world means by it. Of course, for
a person of vivacious temper and strong feelings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>to remain silent, or to say always, ‘I do not know,’
gives full employment to the will and the nerves.
I used sometimes to feel as though I should burst.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, if I should go, it would be to speak when
occasion calls, and to act in accordance with my
speech. I could call a falsehood a falsehood, and
a wrong a wrong.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would have to speak often,” Tacita said
dryly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Should I not!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona began walking to and fro. “I have had
visions of what might be done,” she said, her manner
warming as she proceeded. “The time is past
when San Salvador can be long hidden, when it
should hold itself only a refuge for a few, and a
nursery for a few. I think that the time is come
when it should prepare, prudently, yet with energy,
to practice a Christian aggressiveness. We have
our little circles in every part of the world. They
are silent and true, and they are not poor. We
have no weak hearts. The children of San Salvador
are baptized with fire. The tests of our virtue
and fidelity are severe. Our people have never
occupied public office, because we hold officials responsible;
and by the world they are not so held.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have capital. It might be spent in acquiring
territory. Concentrated, we should be a
power in the world. It is possible. I have the
whole plan in my mind. I have studied over it
for years. I have settled where our outposts
should be, and how they might be strengthened.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>I would deprive no ruler of his realm; but he
should call himself viceroy, and sit on the footstool
of an inviolate throne. I would mock at no
faith of person, or society; but I would show the
whole truth of which each belief is a fragment, and
I would surround worship with such a splendor as
should satisfy any lover of pageantry; and I would
attack all organized wickedness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the early days of our faith Christians did
not fear persecution; for above the head of threatening
king, or pontiff, they saw the face of an approving
God. Only the spirit of Christ himself,
simple and literal, can reawaken that faith. The
first Dylar said that when he abolished preaching,
and set the words of the King in letters of gold
before the people.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me what to do!” said Tacita, leaning to
kiss Iona’s hand as she passed her by.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona paused. “See what I have thought,” she
said in a softened voice. “San Salvador is in danger,
and the danger increases every day. How
long, with explorers and mountain-climbers everywhere,
can we hope to escape? Already, more
than once, we have escaped but by a hair’s-breadth.
We hide by a miracle. Once discovered, what
rights have we? A vulgar, if not malignant,
curiosity follows you everywhere in the world.
Every kind of science and astuteness would be employed
to invade and subdue us. Every sophistical
argument on the subject of sovereign rights,
and even of human rights, would be quoted against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>us. Fancy a man educated in the tricks of diplomacy
and the falsehoods of official life coming
here and claiming the right to investigate and command,
and bringing his subordinates to enforce
submission!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our people are sent out into the world with
every precaution. All are placed above want; but
no one is made rich enough to win the world’s
blinding flatteries. Depending solely on their intrinsic
worth for respect, they are seldom deceived.
But, known as we are, even if force did not invade,
what flatteries! What imitations of our ways
without the spirit! Our realities made theatrical
by their paraphrases—it might be worse than war.
Ordinary society can see no difference between its
own fire of straw and stubble and that primal fire
which, now and then, bursts through some human
soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have thought, then, to acquire all the land
possible about the Olives, planting the plain and
peopling the hills. A mile or two distant there is
a group of hills much like those on which Rome
was built. Our people could come, not as one
people, but as if they were strangers to each other.
Those who would, might even come at first as laborers.
We all know how to labor. For wealth, if
we had workmen and engines, the mountains would
be an immense storehouse. There are beautiful
marbles, and there must be more gold. Then what
refuges we could have, not hidden and crowded,
but open!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Did you think to go out into the world in order
to stir up the people to this movement?” Tacita
asked, when she paused.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona had stopped with her eyes fixed southward,
as if she saw through the mountain wall that measureless
garden, and the city of her imagination
shining in the setting sun.</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned quickly, seeming startled to be reminded
that she was not alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” she said, almost sharply. “And my
brother has told me that Dylar thought I might
wish to go. He spoke to you and you spoke to the
prince. Ion will go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ion feared to grieve you,” Tacita said, surprised
at this sudden address.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dylar also had spoken to me of it,” Iona continued,
her brows lowering. “He thought that I
might like to go awhile with Ion. Why did he
think so? I have never spoken of these plans
to him. I waited for other conditions to arrange
themselves. Why should the idea of my going out
occur to him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know,” said Tacita, more and more
astonished at the tone in which she was addressed.
“He said nothing of it to me. Perhaps he has
some important mission for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why should he intrust a mission to me instead
of Elena, or of going himself?” demanded Iona.
“Can you think of any reason?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know,” Tacita repeated, and her eyelids
drooped.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>There was a moment of silence, and it seemed
to have thundered. Iona gazed with scrutinizing
and flashing eyes into the downcast face before
her, and seemed struggling to control herself. A
shiver passed over her, and then she spoke calmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not told you all my mind. The country
I have planned must have a dynasty, not a
luxurious one secluded from the people, but one
as simple and law-abiding as that which rules us
here. But who will succeed Dylar? While I
planned, that became the difficult question to answer.
He has no child, and seemed vowed to celibacy.
I thought of Ion. He alone, outside the
prince’s blood, might be said to have a certain
prestige, though he has no claim. Ion has force,
and, when he shall have been tried in the alembic,
will have a fine character. He has courage, magnetism,
and enthusiasm. It seemed certain that
Dylar would never marry; and I approved of his
apparent resolution and imitated it. It seemed
fitting that the two highest in San Salvador should
give an example of exceptional lives devoted to its
cause. I had, moreover, a sort of contempt for
that maternity which we share with the beasts, reptiles,
and insects. I almost believed that common
people only should have children and superior people
mould and educate them. In that frame of
mind I had that foolish portrait painted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Later, I saw my mistake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have called the portrait foolish, and it is so
in one sense, in the sense that most people would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>give it, but not in the sense which still to me is
true. For I do set my foot on trivial love and
mere fondness for love’s sake alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was walking to and fro again, her brows
lowering. Tacita sat mute and pale, the vision of
a terrible struggle rising before her mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How perfectly logical an utter mistake may
be!” Iona exclaimed with a sort of fierceness. “I
reasoned with myself. I made it quite plain to
my mind that the people of San Salvador needed
an example of lofty and laborious lives which set
aside for duty’s sake all the joys of domestic life.
I said, ‘This people was elevated for a century to a
higher plane of feeling by such an example.’ It is
a proverb here that the face of Prince Basil shone
a hundred years after he died.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was half right. What kept the Israelites up
to that pitch of enthusiasm which preserved them
great so long? Not the goodness of the mass,
which seemed as base as any, but the divine fire
of the few. What made the great republic of the
west something that for a time was equal to its
own boast? The greatness and disinterested earnestness
of the few. The nation which has no heroic
leader is a prey to the first strong arm or cunning
voice which seeks its subjugation. My plan
would have been perfect if another leader had been
growing up, as in the time of Basil, one of unquestioned
right and character. But as I studied
longer, I saw the flaw. Ion has been known here
as a wayward boy, though noble. Besides, there
has always been a real Dylar.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“Gradually the question readjusted itself in my
mind without my own volition.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dylar and Iona married would unite the actual
right and a shadowy one of sentiment, and the need
of a leader would consecrate the marriage as still
something ideal. Our son could not be a common
one. I would pour all my soul into him. I would
make him enthusiastic, courageous, wise, and eloquent.
He should go down and work beside the
daily laborer, as I have seen Dylar do, till only
labor should seem worthy of a crown. He should
be full of fire, like the old gods. That dead moon-like
calm that people call Olympian is not Olympian.
They were creatures of fire. They trembled
with strong life like flames.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It all flashed upon me. I saw what should be.
But how could I inspire Dylar with my thought!
A woman has limits in such circumstances. Nature
imposes them. I could only wait till my plan
of empire was perfect, then set it before him in all
its splendor. What could he say but ‘Let us
work together for this new Eden! Let the future
viceroy be our son!’ There could be no other
conclusion. It seemed sure, and on the point of
realization. I waited only for his return to lay the
whole before him. And then—and then”—</p>

<p class='c011'>She choked, and, tearing the lace scarf from her
neck, cast it away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita was deathly pale.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Iona,” she said gently, “may it not be that
you expect too much of mankind in the mass?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Can you hope that any nation will long keep its
ideal state? How many such a bubble has burst!
Human life is not a crystallization, but a crucible.
Your kingdom of Christ extended and prosperous,
would it not become a kingdom of the world, as in
the past? It is the old story of the manna, food
from heaven to-day, and to-morrow corruption.
Your saint in power would become, as in the past,
a sinner, and your trusting people, also as in the
past, a populace first of children, then of slaves,
and lastly, of rebels. Forgive me, dear Iona!
Your vision is as noble as yourself; but all are not
like you. Are not you afraid to be so confident?
Your plan opens such a field to ambition!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was not ambitious for myself,” said Iona,
writhing, rather than turning herself away. “And
I believe that rulers may be educated to see how
much grander and happier they would be if the
love of their subjects should exceed their fear. I
thought of the future of our people submerged in
a deluge with no counteracting influence. Perhaps
something suggested”—she turned again to Tacita,
and spoke breathlessly—“When Dylar first
saw that portrait, he did not seem pleased. I
asked myself why he should look so dark if he
approved of my renouncing love. It was my way
of silently telling him that I would take no lower
stand than his. I thought that he would be
pleased. He had never said, but had always
seemed to intimate, that he would not marry.
Once, on going out on a long and dangerous journey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>he said to me: ‘If I should never return, educate
Ion to take my place.’ He trusted me. He
always confided his affairs to me. I never feared
to have him go out. Nothing could seduce him.
I felt sure that he would return even as he went.
To me he was not utterly gone. I told myself that
our spirits communed.” She paused a moment,
then added bitterly: “I thought that they did!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am no queen nor sibyl,” said Tacita faintly.
“I cannot judge of these questions; and I could
never hope to be able to stir a man up to great enterprises.
I am only fitted to be a tender, and in
some small things, a helpful companion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You think that I could not be a tender companion!”
exclaimed Iona jealously. “I have put
a rein upon myself. I will not make my smiles
and caresses so cheap as to give them to everybody.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know that you are capable of great devotion,
Iona,” Tacita said tremulously, her eyes filling with
tears. “Yet the hearts of humbler women may
not be cheaply given, though they may be more
accessible. They may be in something like the
Basilica,—I speak with reverence!—no one rejected
who wishes to enter in kindness, but one
alone enthroned above all the rest, one to whom all
who enter must pay respect. And perhaps the
very kindness felt for all may be an outshining from
that enthroned one, a reflection of the happiness
he gives.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well in its way,” Iona said, trying to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>speak more gently. “But such love is not good
for Dylar when our existence hangs upon a thread.
It is no time for him to think of repose and tender
companionship. It would weaken him. He needs
one who, instead of weeping if danger should
threaten, would send him forth even to death, if
need were, sure that such a death is the higher
safety for him, and for her love the higher possession.
Yet”—she made a haughty gesture and
turned her darkening face away—“it is not that
I love him: it is for San Salvador.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Teach me to be useful, to be strong, Iona!”
said Tacita earnestly. “I would give my life to
the same cause.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you give up a fancy for it?” asked
Iona, looking sharply into her eyes. “It is so
easy to offer a world that is not wanted, and refuse
a grain of sand that is asked for.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would give all that I have the right to give,”
Tacita replied, and felt herself shrivel before this
imperious woman, who stood before her with the
sunset golden on her head and the shadow of a
mountain on her bosom, with her brow made for
a tiara, her lips to command, and her eyes to scathe
with their anger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dylar has asked you to be his wife?” Iona
said, low and quickly.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was something blade-like in the outcome
of this sentence; but it brought help in seeming
to call the conduct of Dylar in question.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita folded her hands, raised her head with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>a dignified gesture, and looked the speaker steadily
in the face without replying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” Iona turned away with a fierce gesture,
then returned. “It is not a son of yours who will
save San Salvador!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps God will save it, Iona,” said Tacita
gently, and rising, went toward the stair.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had descended but a few steps when Iona
followed her. “I hope that I have not been too
rude,” she said. “Pardon me if I have offended
you! The subject is to me of such supreme importance
that I forget all lesser considerations in
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her voice, though conventionally modulated,
had something in it which told her heart was beating
violently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not offended,” murmured Tacita. “I
respect and appreciate your position, your authority,
your rights.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the lower landing they found Dylar. He
looked anxiously at Tacita. “I have been waiting
for you to come down,” he said. “And Elena
has gone to order our supper to be brought here.
We are going to have the sun-dance in the Square.
Do you wish to go home first?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She shook her head, and tried to smile. She
could not speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will leave you both in better company,” Iona
said courteously, declining to stay; and bowing,
left them.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time, to Tacita, it had seemed as if San
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Salvador had opened its walls to admit a salt wave
from the outer world; but the gap closed again
while Dylar attended to her with a careful solicitude
sufficiently reassuring as to his regard for
her, but with no suggestion of fondness. He was
a kind friend; and the cheerfulness and decision of
his manner gave her strength.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is not one,” she thought, “to need the
strength of a woman’s will to keep him in the path
of duty. And she—I am glad that Iona does not
love him. It would break my heart, if she did.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Iona went away with a stately step, but with a
brain on fire. It was only when near the Arcade
that she quickened her steps; and when inside the
door, she ran upstairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having found Elena, “I am going out to the
Olives for a few days,” she said, “and I want to
start at once for the Pines. Will you have Isadore
called to go with me? I will meet him at the
water-gate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She waited for no reply, but hastened to her own
room. In a few minutes she came out dressed in
the gray costume of labor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everything is ready,” Elena said, meeting her,
and expressed neither surprise nor curiosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun had set, and it was night when Iona met
the men who had been sent up to attend her. But
she would suffer them to go no farther than the
water-gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know the road well,” she said, “and am in
no danger. When at daylight you see the signal
that I am at the Pines, you will turn the gate
again. It will be sooner done if you stay here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They obeyed unwillingly, and she went over the
wild mountain road alone, guiding her donkey with
a careful hand, and conscious only of a dull discomfort.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>It was midnight when she reached the
Pines.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be alarmed!” she said cheerfully to the
guardian. “I am sorry to disturb you; but I
wish to go to the Olives. Go to bed now, and be
ready at six in the morning to accompany me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man said no more. They questioned Iona
as little as they did Dylar.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were in the lower room. Iona went to the
chamber above; but when she heard the upper
door close, she came down again, unbarred the outside
door, and went out into the Pines. Space was
what she wanted,—space and solitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a sultry night, and the still air under the
pines was heavily perfumed, not only with their
branches, but with the oppressive sweetness of little
flowering vines that ran about through the moss underneath
them. A mist that was mingled of moisture
and fragrance hung in the tree-tops, and above
them, dimming the stars. It was stupefying.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona felt her way, step by step, over the slippery
ground, and leaned against one of the great pine-boles,
scarcely knowing where she was. There
was left in her mind only a vague sense of ruin and
a vague impulse to escape. She stood there and
stared into the darkness till she was faint and
weary, then sank down where she stood and sat on
the ground. There was an absolute stillness all
about her. The only motion perceptible was in
the narrow strip of sky between the tree-tops and
the rock, where one dim hieroglyph of stars slowly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>gave place to another. Once from some bird’s-nest
not far away came a small complaining note.
Perhaps a wing, or beak, or claw, of some little
sleeper had disturbed its downy neighbor. Then
all was still again. But the little plaintive bird-note
touched the listener’s memory as well as her
ear. The atmosphere of her mind was as heavy as
that around her body, and the suggestion was dim.
She had almost let it slip when it came of itself,
a Turkish proverb: “The nest of the blind bird
God builds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the first whisper of Divine help that had
risen in her soul. Perhaps then it was an angel’s
wing that had disturbed the bird in its sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona glanced upward and saw the pale mists beginning
to quicken with the coming day. “God
help me!” she murmured listlessly, and rising,
went into the house and to her chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>The early training of San Salvador was expressly
calculated to give the child a few indelible
impressions. One of these was to do no desperate
nor extraordinary act without first taking counsel
from some disinterested person, or taking a certain
time “to see if the King would interpose.” In
absenting herself for a while from San Salvador,
Iona had obeyed the sudden command of necessity.
But that step taken, her instinct was to do all as
silently and calmly as possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will not mention Tacita Mora’s name, and I
will work,” she thought. It was the one step in
advance which she could see.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Shortly after sunrise she started for the Olives.
Reaching the turn of the road where the green
began, she descended from her donkey to walk to
the castle, and the man went on to make the necessary
gossip concerning her arrival. For some
reason the first step on the greensward under those
gray-green branches awakened her sleeping passion.
Was it grief that the peacefulness of the
scene knocked in vain at her heart for entrance?
She would willingly have thrown herself down in
those quiet shadows and wept. The strong check
she drew on the impulse brought up its contrary,
and she laughed lightly.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no one in the great circular ground-room
of the tower, nor on the grand stairs where
a man might ride up and down on horseback; but
reaching the top, she was met by the housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take my arm,” the woman said. “You must
be very tired. I saw you from the window,” and
she gave no intimation of surprise nor curiosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am tired and hungry and sleepy,” Iona said
smilingly, availing herself of the offered support.
“I find that I have not had exercise enough, and
am too quickly fatigued. That is so easy with what
I have to do. But I have come out here to work.
If you will bring me a cup of chocolate, I will then
try to sleep. I reached the Pines very late last
night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She went to the chamber that was called hers,
drank the chocolate that was brought her, and,
overcome by fatigue, fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Prince Dylar has sent you the keys,” the housekeeper
said to her when she woke. “He said that
you forgot them. The messenger is waiting to
know if there is any word to take back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“None except to thank the prince for taking so
much trouble,” Iona said.</p>

<p class='c011'>If she were more irritated or soothed by Dylar’s
evident anxiety it would not have been easy to say.
The sending of the keys, too, besides giving an opportunity
to learn if she were well, was a reminder
of his confidence in her and of her importance to
San Salvador. They were the keys of his private
apartment, the treasure-vault, and of the door leading
to the ravine where a stream of water still
brought an occasional grain of gold.</p>

<p class='c011'>She opened the case with a little key of her own,
and looked eagerly to see if there were any written
word, snatching out the slip of paper that she
found.</p>

<p class='c015'>She read: “I think that the late rains may
have washed out a few grains of gold. I did
not go when I was last at the castle. Will you
look?</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Dylar.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Just as if nothing had happened! Iona put her
hand to her forehead and for a moment wondered
if anything had happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must work hard!” she thought. “‘When
nature is in revolt, put her into the treadmill;’”
and she went out to see what there was to do, going
from house to house, greeting the people and welcomed
by them. They supposed that she had just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>arrived from some distant city, but asked no questions,
knowing that she was one of Dylar’s messengers.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a field of wheat ripened, and Iona put
on a broad-brimmed hat and thick gloves, and taking
a sickle, went out to it across the vineyards.
“I am to do it all,” she said laughingly. “Let
no one come near me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Had any one in San Salvador seen her speaking
to those people, he would have thought that he had
never seen her so gay; and had he seen her when,
leaving all behind, she went out alone, he would
have wondered at the gloomy passion of her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>She put her sickle into the grain, and bent to
her work like any habitual laborer. In fact, she
had done the same work before in play. Handful
by handful, the golden glistening stalks fell in a
straight ridge across the field; and as the movement
grew mechanical, her thoughts took, as it
were, a sickle, and began to reap in another field.
With a savage strength it cut through the years of
her life, all its golden promise and fulfillment, all
its holy aspirations, all its towering visionary
building which had been, indeed, but a dream of
empire and of love. It cut through the humbler
growth of sweetness blooming like the little blue
flowers she severed from their roots and cast aside
to wither, or trampled under her feet. As she
wrought thus, sternly, with a double blade, the
mental harvest even more real to her mind than this
one that the June sun shone upon, her breath kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>time with a sharp hiss to the hiss of the sickle, and
her heart bled.</p>

<p class='c011'>With no cessation from her labor except to wipe
the perspiration from her face, she reaped till sunset.
Then, after standing a little while in doubt
what next to do, she bent again, and reaped till
the stars came out. Their lambent shining through
the falling dew lighted her back to the castle. The
windows were all open in the houses as she passed
them, and some of the people were seated at supper
in their great basement rooms, as large as
churches, with their rows of arches, instead of
walls, supporting the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let no one touch my work,” Iona called gayly
in at one of the windows, “unless you should wish
to bring in what I have reaped. I have put a cornice
around the field. I would have reaped all
night if there were a moon. Good-night. Peace
be with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They echoed her salutation; and she hung her
sickle on the outer wall, and took her way to the
castle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t tell me that you have had your supper!”
the housekeeper said; “for I have taken such pleasure
in preparing one for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall eat it, for I have earned it,” Iona
replied, taking off her coarse gloves and straightening
out her cramped fingers.</p>

<p class='c011'>But what she ate she knew not, nor what good
fairy suggested to her questions and answers and
remarks that were to her as dry as husks, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>which served as a screen to her misery. She
seemed to have a secondary mind which worked
mechanically.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are certain proverbial sayings which have
an air of such owl-like wisdom and are such a saving
of mental work to those who repeat them that
they seem immortal. One of these is that no person
is fit to command who cannot obey. If it were
said that no person is fit to command an inferior
who cannot obey a superior, a reasonable idea
would be conveyed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Setting aside such cases as the apprenticeship of
Apollo to a swineherd, and the voluntary self-humiliation
of an ascetic who seeks to win heaven
by effacing himself on earth, there is no more murderous
injustice than the enforced subjection of a
lofty nature to a lower one. It is not a question
of pride, nor of fitness; it is a question of individual
existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona had been like a queen in San Salvador;
and she had been a wise and gentle sovereign.
She had assumed no authority, and fully acknowledged
that she had none. She was always consulted,
and she had made no mistakes. Her whole
strength had been expended to make herself worthy
of this preëminence, and she had succeeded. Her
powers had risen with the need of them, and she
stood upright, sustained by this pressure from all
sides.</p>

<p class='c011'>The pressure removed, for to her mind it was almost
removed and would be totally so, she collapsed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>and fell into confusion. With Tacita the wife of
Dylar, she took for granted that her reign in San
Salvador was at an end. For it was her power
in the community, she persistently told herself,
not her power over the heart of Dylar, which she
lamented. “It is not love! I do not love him!”
she had repeated a hundred times.</p>

<p class='c011'>To her mind, Tacita, however sweet and lovely,
was a girl of limited capacity, but also one who
could assume a dignified and even haughty reserve
when her relations with Dylar were called into
question. As his wife, she might object to any
other female authority in the place; and Iona well
knew that the fair-haired girl, with her charming
grace and caressing manners, would win a greater
affection from the people than she herself would be
able to win by the devotion of a life.</p>

<p class='c011'>She went to her chamber with the hope of sleeping;
but sleep was impossible. She rose, took her
lamp, and went downstairs, meeting the housekeeper
on the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going out through the cellar,” she said.
“Give me a long roll of wax taper, and the key of
the cellar door. I will take care of all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She tied the great roll of taper to her girdle,
took a little wallet and a lamp, and went down to
the cellar. But instead of descending the second
stair, she went along under the damp arches,
past the rows of moist hogsheads, to a little stair
that went up to a walled-up door. The stairs had
been utilized as shelves, and rows of jars and little
bottles of olives were set along them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Iona cleared them all away from the four lower
steps, and with a deft hand took out two or three
screws from the boards; then, turning back the
three lower stairs like a door, disclosed a steep
stair underneath through a square opening. The
stair ended in a corridor from which was heard the
sound of waters, growing clearer as the passage led
into a cave that had a high opening at one side, like
a round window, almost lost in a long, close passage
that looked as if broken in the rock by an
earthquake, louder again when a door was unlocked
and opened into a roofless passage of which one
side diminished in height and showed a fringe of
little plants and mosses, and the other soared, a
precipice. Here was a little hollow through which
flowed a brook coming through crevices northward
to disappear southward into crevices. Where it
issued from the rock in a fall of a few feet were
two troughs, side by side, turning on a hinge, so
that the water might be made to pass through
either. Both were lined with nets that could be
raised and drained.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona set her lamp on the rock, changed the
troughs, and carefully raised the net in the one
through which the water had been passing, and
with a little wire spade turned over the débris left
there. Where a yellow glimmer showed, she picked
it out and put it into the wallet hanging at her
side.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night was so still that the flame of the lamp
scarcely wavered; but she swung her coil of lighted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>taper to and fro, and round in a circle, to catch any
glimmer of the precious metal hidden there.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was neither tree nor shrub in sight.
Grotesque peaks and cliffs rose on every side, shutting
her in. Scintillating overhead was the Milky
Way, a white torrent of stars from the heights of
heaven flowing between the black rock-rims that it
seemed almost to touch.</p>

<p class='c011'>The gold came in glimmer after glimmer, some
almost too small to gather out of the slippery débris,
others half as large as the flame of the lamp,
and brightly glowing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona’s spirit revived a little. The place, the
time, and the occupation took her out of the track
of her habitual life. She recollected her first visit
to this place, when she and Dylar were children.
They came with his father. The prince had
brought her after her father’s death, hoping to distract
her; and while she and the boy picked out
the shining grains, he sat on a lichened rock beside
them, and told how men had spent their lives
in searching for and compounding the philosopher’s
stone in order to make at will this bright
king of metals which they were gathering from the
sand.</p>

<p class='c011'>He told how kings and queens had lavished patronage
and treasure on such seekers after hidden
knowledge, and the names by which the magic
stone was called: <em>The daughter of the great secret;
The sun and his father; The moon and her mother</em>.
He told them the legend that St. John, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Evangelist, could make gold; and young Dylar
paused in his search to learn the verses of an old
hymn to the saint that the alchemists applied to
themselves:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inexhaustum fert thesaurum</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui de virgis faeit aurum,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gemmas de lapidibus.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>He described to them the <em>dry way</em> and the <em>humid
way</em>, the <em>white powder</em>, that changed metals
to fine silver, the <em>red elixir</em>, which made gold and
healed all sorts of wounds, the <em>white elixir</em>, <em>white
daughter of the philosophers</em>, which made silver
and prolonged life indefinitely. He told them
the prediction of a German philosopher that in the
nineteenth century gold would be produced by galvanism,
and become so common that kitchen utensils
would be made of it. “But that,” the prince
added, “will surely be a gift of wrath, and will
come like a thunderbolt. Men will play with fire,
and it will turn upon them. They will laugh in
the face of God when they snatch his lightnings
out of his hand, and he will reduce them to ashes.
But to him who kneels and waits, into his hand
will God put the lightning, and it shall be as dew
to his palm when he smites with it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As he had talked, sometimes to them, and then
as if to himself, to her imagination all the space
about and above had become filled with watching
faces. There were pale brows over eyes grown
dim and hollow with fruitless study; there were
clustering locks that wore the shadow of a crown;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>there were dreamy faces whose eyes were filled
with visions of the golden streets of the New Jerusalem;
there were the hungry cheeks and devouring
eyes of poverty; there was avarice with human features;
and over the shoulders of these, and peering
through their floating hair or widespread beard,
were impish eyes and glimpses of impish mirth;
all which, with sudden explosion, were wrapped one
moment in flame, and the next, fell in a mass of
gold like a mountain, writhing one instant, then
fixed. And in the place where they had been remained
unscathed one face still gazing in a dream
at the golden streets of the New Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c011'>The childish vision rose and fell; but it left a
scene almost as unreal.</p>

<p class='c011'>There showed no more sparkling points in the
trough, and Iona changed it for the other, glancing
into the second as she withdrew it. At the
bottom of the net was a spark like a star. It was
a little ball of gold that the water had brought
while she was searching. She smiled at sight of
it, scarcely knowing why it pleased her; and instead
of putting it into the wallet, found a dew-softened
flake of lichen to wrap it in, and hid it in
her bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will ask Dylar if I may give it to Ion when
he goes out,” she thought; and the image of Ion
warmed her heart. “Dear boy!” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dew, the darkness, and the silence soothed
her as she walked homeward. Seen from a distance
she might have seemed a glow-worm creeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>along the face of the rock. Her lamp grew
dim, and she lighted her taper again by its expiring
flame, and went on uncoiling it as it rapidly
consumed in the faint breeze of her motion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Weary, and in some way comforted, she reached
the castle and her chamber, and was soon asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>But anguish woke with her, the stronger for its
repose. The novelty of the change was gone, and
a consuming fever of impatience to return to San
Salvador took possession of her. But she had
come for a week, and she stayed a week, passing
such days and nights as made her cheeks thin and
her eyes hollow.</p>

<p class='c011'>The morning she had set for her return she was
scarcely able to rise; but at noon she reached the
Pines, and while everybody in San Salvador was
at supper, she quietly entered the Arcade, and sent
for Elena to come to her room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give these to Dylar with your own hand,” she
said, consigning to her care the wallet and the case
of keys. “And please send me some supper here.
I am going up the hills this evening, and may stay
all day to-morrow. Whoever comes with my food
can set the basket on the terrace, if I am not in
sight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena looked at that worn face, and could not
restrain an expostulation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Iona, dear, you look too tired to go up there
alone to-night,” she said. “Wait till morning,
and no one shall come near you, nor even know that
you are here.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“I should suffocate here!” Iona exclaimed impatiently.</p>

<p class='c011'>Elena urged her no farther. “At least, make
me a sign in the morning that you are well,” she
said. “Tie a white cloth to the terrace post.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes! Don’t fear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She went out. It was twilight, and the windows
were beginning to be lighted. In the Square she
saw Ion going toward the college. She drew the
silver whistle from her sash and blew his name.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy stopped, then came running back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going up the hills to stay to-night,” his
sister said, holding him in her arms. “Don’t tell
any one, unless Dylar should ask you. And see!
I have a gift for you. It is a little ball of pure
gold. Say nothing of it even to Dylar till I tell
you. Keep it as a memento of San Salvador when
you are far away. And now, good-night, my treasure,
my better than gold!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She kissed him tenderly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O Iona, why do you go up there to-night?” the
boy cried. “What is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She freed herself from him gently, but decidedly.
“Don’t oppose me, Ion. Do as I bid you, and
say good-night now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He urged no more, but went away dejectedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cottage to which Iona went was a tiny one
with a plot of herbs in front of it and a huge fig-tree.
It contained but one room, across which was
slung a wide hammock. She opened the door,
prepared her hammock and got into it, dressed as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>she was. There was a floating wick in a vase of
oil and water that gave just light enough to faintly
define the objects in the room and show a small
fragment of paper on the floor. As she lay, glancing
restlessly about, her eyes returned again and
again to this paper, and finally with a sense of annoyance.
She was naturally orderly and neat to a
fault even; and now it seemed as if all her characteristics
had become either numbed or fantastic.
That scrap of paper grew to be of such importance
to her that she could not rest while it lay there;
and having risen to pick it up, it was still of so
much importance to her that she could not set fire
to it in the little night-lamp without looking to see
what it was. It was a fragment of an old pamphlet
in which had been an article on mediæval customs.
The few lines remaining referred to a custom
in the isle of Guernsey.</p>

<p class='c011'>It related that if a sale of property were being
made by heirs, one heir objecting, this non-consenting
one could stop the sale by crying out: “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A
l’aide, mon prince! On me fait tort!</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>She read, then burned the paper. It was an interesting
fact. She thought it over, going to lie in
her hammock again; and thinking of it, dropped
asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were a few hours of repose. Then she
waked and could sleep no more. The little lamp
had burned out, and the dark dewy night looked in
at her open window. She rose and went out.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fig-tree before her door grew a single straight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>trunk to a height of four feet, or a little more, then
divided into two great branches, hollowed out and
widespreading. Iona leaned into this hollow, hanging
with all her weight, and looked over the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A l’aide, mon prince! On me fait tort!</span></i>” she
murmured, recollecting the words that she had slept
repeating. And she stretched her hands out toward
Dylar’s dwelling-place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They think that she alone has power to charm
you!” she went on. “Blind that they are! And
are you also blind? They see me preside with dignity,
and they think that I am nothing but stately.
Cannot you understand that I am as full of laughter
as a brook? I have come up here alone many
a time and talked with the birds, the plants, and
the wind. I came to give vent to the life that was
bubbling in me. If I had but shown it! If I had
but shown it! The greatest force I ever put upon
myself was to be cool and calm with you. It was
honor made me. I thought you were resolved to
lead the angelic life, and I would not by a smile,
or a glance, or a wile make it harder for you. How
could I imagine that you would surrender yourself
unsought to a lesser woman! Oh, I could have
charmed you! Cannot I call you now? Shall I
submit without a struggle?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona knew in herself a compelling power of will,
without defining it. It had sometimes seemed to
her that when roused by some vivid interest, her
will had flung out an invisible lasso that bound
whomsoever she would; not so much, indeed, here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>in San Salvador as out in the world, where minds
were less firmly anchored. Yet even here, finding
one in a receptive mood, she had more than once
made him swerve as she had wished.</p>

<p class='c011'>Could she not in this hour of supreme upheaval
send her soul out—all her soul—through the space
that divided her from Dylar, make it grow around
him like a still moonrise, find him where he lay
thinking, or dreaming, perhaps, of that fair-haired
Tacita, reach into, shine into, his heart and blot
that image out, gather all his will into the grasp of
her strong life, and so melt and bend him that he
should turn to her as a flower to the light? Dylar
had a strong will. She had seen him as oak and
iron. But, if she should slip in at unawares!</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona caught herself leaning over, straining over
the inverted arch of the fig-tree, her arms extended
toward the college, the fingers cold and electric,
the very locks of her loose hair seeming to be
turned that way, her whole person having a strange
feeling as if a strong current of some sparkling, benumbing
essence were flowing from her toward the
spot where Prince Dylar lay helpless and unconscious.</p>

<p class='c011'>She started back. “God forbid!” she cried.
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A l’aide, mon prince!</span></i>” The last words came as
of themselves; and her prince was still Dylar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet it would be for his good and the good of
San Salvador,” she said, and began to weep.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then again, half frightened at her own passion,
her mood changed. After all, was she certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>that her fears were well-grounded? What proof
had she? Nothing strong except Tacita’s silence;
and might she not have mistaken the significance
of that? Her nature seemed to divide itself in two,
one weak, wretched, dying, the other seeking to
comfort, reassure, and save this despairing creature
from destruction. Her imagination began to hold
up pictures to divert the weeping child of earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>She fancied Dylar in the first enthusiasm of knowing
all her plans. He would adore her. But
there should be no silly dalliance. For, “I do not
love him in that way,” she still persisted. When
she should crown herself with the white betrothal
roses that must be gathered by her own hand, it
would be with the thought of authority wearing the
crown of pure justice. When she should assume
the rose-colored robe and veil of a bride, it would
be to her a figure of that charity all over the world
which it would be the aim of her life to promote.
Both she and Dylar would be stronger for this
companionship; and she would be, not only his inspirer,
but his soothing and comforting friend also.
Every lion in his path should become his beehive.
When he was weary of empire she would charm
him with many a folly. For sometimes he would
be depressed, perhaps, even out of temper. It was
delicious to think of him so—as quite a common
man—for a little while. It would be the dear little
flaw in her gem.</p>

<p class='c011'>All should come as she had planned. Their
colonies should condense in the plain and on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>hills outside, little by little, stealing in as silent as
mists, not seeming one, but as strangers to each
other. Here at San Salvador should be their
stronghold, as now, and their inmost sanctuary.
But they would live outside, on a hill, or going
from place to place. When all was well ordered
without, they would come back for a while, and she
would lead Dylar to some height, to the summit of
the North Peak, where there should be a mirador,
and pointing to their colonies embossing the whole
circle even to the horizon, she would say: “Behold
the marriage-portion I brought you!” She would
tell him of a time when, their earthly lives ended,
they might be borne, like Serapeon, over mountain
top and plain, while their son—</p>

<p class='c011'>Their son!</p>

<p class='c011'>Her fancy descended from its cold mountain
height to a green hollow in the hills, and a cooing
of doves, and a veil of heliotrope shutting them in.
She hung over the face of the child. His cradle
should be formed like a lotos-flower, and there he
should sit enthroned like Horus, the young Day.
As her fancy dwelt on him, he grew,—a youth
with inspiration shining in his eyes, a man, with
command on his brow. He should bring in a
golden age. Peace and brotherly love prevailing
should make men look upon their past lives as the
lives of wolves. He should wear white while
young, and purple when he began to take the reins
of government. The white should have a violet
border.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Here the dreamer’s fancy seemed to stumble as
if caught in the train of a white robe with a violet
border that brought some disenchanting reminiscence
in its folds.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the robe that Tacita had worn the last
time they met at the assembly, and she had looked
like a Psyche in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>As that figure floated, smiling, into her dream,
Iona’s empire crumbled, her lover became a mocking
delusion, her shining babe faded to a snow-drop
broken from its stem, her enthusiastic youth shrank
like dry leaves, her purple-robed prince fell with a
crash at her feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A—a—a—i!”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was almost like the growl and spring of the
tiger. But the rein was drawn as involuntarily as
a falling person seeks to maintain his equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A l’aide, mon Roi!</span></i>” she cried, and stretched
her hands out, not toward Dylar, but toward the
Basilica, showing faint and ghost-like against the
western mountains. “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A l’aide, mon Dieu!</span></i>” and
lifted her face to heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'>To a strong, high soul, despair is impossible.
However dark the overhanging cloud, it never believes
that there is no help. It has felt its own
wings in the sunshine, and it knows that somewhere
there must be a way for them to lift it out of the
storm.</p>

<p class='c011'>But where?</p>

<p class='c011'>“My father told me to do without love, if I
could,” thought Iona, and sank down, and sat leaning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>against the tree.  The time-blurred image of
that father rose before her mind, and the scenes
following his death.  Of her life with him, except
that it was happy, she could recollect nothing definite.
With the egotism and ignorance of youth she
had taken a father’s loving presence for granted,
as she had taken sunshine and air.  He had died
at Castle Dylar, and she was with him.  His illness
was brief, she had scarcely known that he was
ill.  For one day only she had not seen him.</p>

<p class='c011'>She seemed again to stand, a child, in the middle
of the great salon, looking at a closed door.  The
prince held her hand and murmured words of consolation.
Her playmate, young Dylar, stood at
a distance wistfully gazing at them.  She did not
understand for what she needed to be consoled; but
an undefined dread oppressed her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is in that room?” asked the child with a
gloomy imperiousness.  “They close the door, and
tell me not to open it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only a mortal body from which the soul has
fled,” said the prince.  “Your real father has gone
to see the King, to see your dear mother; and both,
unseen, will watch over you and your little brother.
Do not you want to go home and see poor little
Ion?  He is alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to see my father’s body,” said the child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Iona, he sleeps!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wake him, then!” she cried.  “Or, no.  I
will be quiet and let him sleep.  I will sit by him
till he wakes.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Dylar looked distressed.  “Dear child, no one
ever wakes from that sleep, it is so full of peace
and rest.  His heart does not beat.  His hands
are as cool as dew.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wake him!” she cried, beginning to sob; and,
snatching her hand away, ran to beat on the door,
and call “Father! Father!” with an awful pause
of silence between one call and the other.  “If he
were warm he would speak.  Give him wine!  I
can make his heart beat.  Let me in!  I will go to
him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing can make the body warm when the
soul has gone out of it,” said Dylar, following her
to the door.  “It is like a candle that is not
lighted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I kiss him, he will light,” persisted the
child.  “He always does.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“His light is in the court of the King,” said
Dylar.  “You must not, cannot call it back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The child stood silent a moment, a statue of rebellious
grief, trying to understand the cold science
of death, now for the first time presented to her.
Then, with something more of self control, she
asked:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can I make the King give back his soul, in
any way? no matter if it is not by being good.
Could I by being wicked?  I am not afraid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By being bad you would only separate yourself
still more from your father.  My child, he
was not torn away.  He went submissively, obediently.
He bade me love you as my own child, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>I will.  The King took him gently by the hand.
Wait a little while, and he will come for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The child’s head drooped.  She leaned against
the door, putting her arms up to it in a vain and
empty embrace.  “I want to go in!” she said
faintly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The prince opened the door and led her in.</p>

<p class='c011'>A white veiled shape lay stretched out on a narrow
bed.  The prince folded back a cloth, and the
child’s dilating eyes, startled and awe-stricken,
looked for the first time on death.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it a statue?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is his own body in its long sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have always seen him breathe,” she whispered,
looking up at her guardian with frightened eyes.
“His breast went up and down—so!” she panted.
“I felt it when he held me in his arms.  I did not
know that it could stop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sobs broke out.  She threw herself on to the cold
breast and clung to it.  “He spoke; and I thought
that it was a little thing,” she cried, in a storm of
tears.  “Sometimes I did not listen.  I thought
that I could always hear him speak.  Sometimes
he told me to do a thing, and I said no.  I did not
think that he would ever be ‘no’ to me.  He is
all ‘No!’  Speak one word, father!  It is Iona.
Why can he not speak?  This is his hair, his face,
his own self,—all but the cold!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He cannot hear you,” said the prince.</p>

<p class='c011'>The child rose and looked wildly about.  “I
would climb over all these mountains, barefoot and
alone in the dark, to hear him say one word!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>And then, in that day of revelations, there was
yet another which startled her for a moment out
of her own grief.  For Prince Dylar, raising his
arms and his face upward, exclaimed with passion:
“O Heavenly Father, do we not expiate the sin,
whatever it was!” and for the first time she saw a
man weep.</p>

<p class='c011'>How vividly it all rose before her!  How like
was that child to herself!</p>

<p class='c011'>“How glad I am that I put my arms around him
and tried to comfort him!” she thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My heart has been broken once before, and it
healed,” she said, and returned to the present,
where her mind swung idly to and fro, like a pendulum,
counting mechanically the minutes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dawn began. It was not like the tingling
white fire, alive to its faintest wave, of dawns that
she had seen.  It was still and solemn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A l’aide, mon Roi, man Dieu!</span></i>” Iona murmured
drearily; and speaking, remembered the
invitation: <em>Come unto me, all ye that labor and
are heavy laden, and I will give you rest</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>What did it mean?  She understood duty and
obedience toward God; but an ardent worship of
the whole being, a clinging of the spirit through
the sense, she did not understand.  It had seemed
to her material and unworthy.  She forgot that the
sense also is the work of God.  The spirit should
rise above the sense, leaving it behind, despising
it, she had thought; but to lift the sense also, to
bathe it in that fire that burns not, to lead it by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>hand, like a poor lame sister, into the healing Presence,
that she knew not.  Her worship dispersed
itself in air.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will go to him!” she said.  “But where?
He is everywhere; therefore he is here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She knelt, folded her hands, and said, “Help
me, O Lord! for I am in bitter need,” and said
it wearily.  The universal affirmation of his presence
had for effect only universal negation.  She
did not find him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dawn grew. She rose from her knees,
weary and faint.  “How are we to know when
God helps us?  Perhaps when some path shall be
opened for me out of this labyrinth.  Is this all
that religion can give me?—the patience of exhaustion,
or the apathy of resignation?  Is this
rest?  No matter!  I will obey.  I will ask help
every day, and try to do my duty.  What is meant
by loving God?  I cannot love all out-doors.  If
Christ were here as he was once upon the earth, he
would not make me wait one hour with my heart
all lead.  If he were here!  Oh, I would walk all
barefoot and alone in the dark over the mountains,
over the world, to hear him speak one word!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun rose, and its golden veil was let down
slowly over the western mountains, creeping toward
the Basilica.  When it touched, she could see
from where she stood in her door the sparkling of
the crown-jewels.  They seemed to rejoice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will go to his house to ask help,” said Iona.
“Why should he have a house among us, if not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>give audience there to his children!  But now I
must sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She went to tie her handkerchief on the little
balustrade of her terrace for a sign to Elena, and
returning, closed the door, leaving the window ajar.
Getting into her hammock then, she swung herself,
to sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was late in the afternoon when she waked, and
the sun was shining into the room in a long,
bright bar through the window.  In the midst of
that light was the shadow of a head.  As she
looked at the shadow-head it turned aside in a listening
attitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona rose and opened the door, and Ion sprang
up joyfully.  He had brought her breakfast and
left it outside the door, and come again with her
dinner, both waiting untasted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I peeped in and saw that you were asleep,” he
said.  “Are you not hungry?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She ate something, not more from faintness than
to please him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was so tired. I worked hard at the Olives,
and did not sleep till late.  And now, dear boy, go
down.  I have something to do, and something for
you to do.  To-night, after the people are out of
the street, I am going to the Basilica.  I wish to
go alone.  When the portal is closed, get the key
of the south side door, and leave it in the lock.
Thank you for coming up!  You are always good
to Iona!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She kissed him smilingly, and let him go.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In a great mental upheaval, to be able to decide,
even on a point of secondary importance, is helpful.
It is like a plank to the shipwrecked.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such to her was Iona’s resolution to go to the
Basilica and watch all night.  Christ had said
“Come!” and she would go as near to him as she
knew how.  The sense of blind obedience was restful.
She looked across the town, and a certain
peacefulness seemed to hover over the white building
beyond the river.  She thought herself like
that river, flowing in silent shadow now after a
wild rush from height to depth, and through dark
and stormy ways.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no assembly that evening, and the
avenue and square were unlighted.  But the roof-terraces
were populous, and a murmur of voices
and of music came from them.  They called to
each other across the narrow streets; and when
some one sang to mandolin or guitar in one terrace,
the near ones hushed themselves to listen.  It
seemed to Iona like something that she had heard
of long before, it was so far away, and had so lost
its spirit and color.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are times when to hear laughter gives one
a feeling of terror such as might be felt if it came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>from a train of cars about to roll down a precipice.
When Dante came up from the Inferno, careless
laughter must have affected him so.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Iona entered the Basilica, locking the door
behind her, the sweet, true word of an English
writer recurred to her: “Solitude is the antechamber
to the presence of God.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She knelt before the Throne a moment; then,
seating herself on the cushioned step, waited for
some plan of life to suggest itself to her as possible
and tolerable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be outside the mountains,” she began,
then checked herself.  “It shall be where God
wills.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But, oh, the torment of it!  The utter collapse
of all spirit and elasticity!</p>

<p class='c011'>The shadows of the portal came up to fall before
the light of the tribune, and the light went down
to meet the shadows.  Darker slanting shadows of
columns crossed the dim side aisles.  There were
panels of deep, rich color between, growing
brighter toward the tribune.  On the balustrades
were thirty-three lamps, one for each year of the
King’s life.  They climbed in a narrowing flame-shape
with the Throne and the tiara.  In the jewels
a sleeping rainbow stirred.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona rose and wandered about the church.
What more could she say, or do?  Was she to go
out as blind and unconsoled as she had entered?
The silence was terrible.  It occurred to her that
having had no conscious and pressing need of God,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>she had gone on fancying herself in communion
with him when there had been no living communion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do we, indeed, know that God whom we profess
to believe in?” she asked herself.  “Have I
not as ‘ignorantly worshiped’ him as did the
Athenians of St. Paul’s time?  Oh, if I find him
not to-night, I shall die!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing up a side aisle, she paused before the
picture of a tiger there, which stood in a strong
light, and stared at the Throne.  She lifted her
hand to pat his head, and whispered, half smiling,
“Have you found the secret, brother?”  Then she
went on and knelt again before the tribune, questioning:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who, then, have I come here to seek, and
what?  A glorious and triumphant Deity?  Something
more, indeed!  I seek one who knows sorrow,
poverty, and betrayal.  Where is he?  Where is
the compassion, the power, the voice of him?  I
must find him, meet him!  Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She set herself to call up some image of him as
human creatures had seen him face to face in their
need.  She recalled other vigils of knight, crusader,
mourner, and sinner.  Above all was the supreme
vigil of Mary Magdalen.  Ah, what a night
of anguish!  Ah, what a rapturous morn!  To hear
him speak her name as he uttered that “Mary!”
on the first Easter morning would be better than a
thousand princes of her blood ruling through ten
thousand years, would be better than to have
Dylar look at her with love’s delight.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>She evoked that scene out of the past,—the
chill, dewy garden, the lonely sepulchre, the dull
hour before dawn.  The present faded from her
view.  Gleam of gold and sparkle of jewel, she set
them aside.  Blotting out the glow of lamps and
the glimmer of marble, it came.  She was in the
garden with Mary Magdalen.  The stone was
rolled away, she heard the woman’s bitter outcry:
<em>They have taken my Lord away, and I know not
where they have laid him!</em></p>

<p class='c011'>Darkness, sorrow, and desolation reigned.  Even
the Magdalen, weeping bitterly, departed.  She
was alone before an empty sepulchre.</p>

<p class='c011'>Said faith: “He is here even as he was there,
the same.  He is invisibly here in this place, even
as he was there.  If he be God, he is here.  Hush,
my soul!  He is here!  He is here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>A Presence grew in the place, felt by her whole
being, a sense of life, gentle and potent.  Seen
by her soul, Christ stood there looking at her, and
waiting to hear what she might say.</p>

<p class='c011'>She stretched her hands out to him with a wild
burst of tears.  “What shall I do?” she sobbed.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, oh, wonder of wonders!  A voice “still and
small,”—the voice that was heard by Elijah,—a
voice more distinct to her soul and her senses than
her own sobbing question had been, answered her!</p>

<p class='c011'>The angel of truth guides the pen with which I
write these words!</p>

<p class='c011'>The voice came not from the shadows where she
had evoked his image by the mystical incantation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>faith.  It spoke at her right side, each word let fall
like a pearl, so that she turned her head to listen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Were they words of compassion, or counsel?
Did they propose a plan, or commend her obedience?</p>

<p class='c011'>No.  They only repeated the Divine invitation:
<em>Come unto me, all ye that labor, and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as they fell softly on her ear, the darkness
that had enveloped her parted, and slipped down
like a tent, and a flood of light entered and illumined
her soul.  Her hands were still outstretched;
but they were clasped in ecstasy: her tears still
flowed; but they were tears of rapture.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, why did I not think of it!” she exclaimed;
and in that first inflowing of heaven did not remember
that she <em>had</em> thought, and <em>had</em> come, and
that the words were but a reminder that she had
done her part, and there remained only that he
should fulfill his promise.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was in heaven!</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no thought of explanation, no study
of phenomena.  She knew at last what sort of
miracle Christ came on earth to perform, and what
his kingdom is.</p>

<p class='c011'>How was her life to proceed?  It mattered not.
Whatever might happen, all was well, was more
than well, was best!  Should she go, or stay in San
Salvador?  No matter.  She was blest either way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And this heaven,” she thought, “lies just outside
the door of every human heart!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“<em>Behold, I stand at the door and knock.</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>How simple is a spiritual miracle, after all!  It
is but the substitution of harmony for discord, the
finding the keynote of the universe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not the least marvelous part of her change was
that she recognized this state as her true one; as
one who has long been cramped and bowed down
breathes deep with relief, the pressure removed,
and knows that he was made to stand upright.</p>

<p class='c011'>No earthly storm clears so. Even when the sun
bursts forth, he shows a rack of flying mists.  But
Iona no longer thought of a shadow, even as past.
Trouble had no longer any existence, even as fugitive.
<em>In the twinkling of an eye</em>, says Saint Paul.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was early dawn when she issued from the Basilica.
Some one was pacing one of the paths in
the green above, but came running down as soon
as she appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Ion!  What brings you here?” his sister
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could not sleep,” the boy said, trembling.
“Oh, Iona, what is the matter with you?  What
has happened?  Let us both go away from here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She put her arms around him. “Dear Ion,” she
said, “the brightest, the sweetest, the most glorious
thing has happened!  Some time I will tell you,
but not now.  Your hair is wet with dew, and
your cheeks with tears, my dearest.  Do not fear.
All is well!  All is well!  Do not I look happy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your face shines!” said Ion, his own growing
brighter.  “I was afraid.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“You are to fear no longer.  You must go to
rest, and then wake happy.  But first let us kiss
the panels of the portal; for they have been to me
the gate of heaven.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They went, hand in hand, knelt on the upper
step, and kissed the panels of the door, then walked
in silence across the town.  In the dawn, the face
of Iona could be seen radiant with a light that was
not of the sky.  It was the outshining of an illuminated
soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Brother,” she said, pausing at the door of the
Arcade, “what the King said is not a figure of
speech, but literal truth.  When he commands, or
invites, do not stop to question.  To him there are
no impossibilities.  Do not forget him, nor disobey
when life is bright; but he is a star, best seen in
the dark.  If you should ever be in great anguish,
set your soul searching for Christ, and do not leave
off till you find him.  He is near! He is always
within call!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She went upstairs, planning.  First sleep.  Then
this duty, then that, quite as usual.  And every
duty, even those heretofore most nearly irksome,
had a new face, smiling and peaceful.  Every little
weed and brier of life put forth its blossom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Reaching Tacita’s door, she stopped; and hearing
a movement within, she whispered:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tacita Mora!  O Tacita!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita was awake.  Her heart had been sorely
troubled by Iona’s talk the week before; and her
sudden absence had increased the pain.  She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>opened the door, wondering at that whisper, and
shrank on seeing who was there.  “What do you
wish for?” she asked, fearing some new and more
violent scene.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To restore you the peace I have disturbed,”
said Iona.  “To ask your forgiveness.  All the
wild things I said that day were a dark delusive
cloud which has been driven away by sun and
wind.  I was wrong, and you right.  It is the
Holy Saviour himself who will save the refuge
they have named for him.  I hope, dear, that you
and Dylar will marry, and be happy; but it would
be presuming in me to ask of your intentions.
Peace!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She went swiftly away before Tacita, astonished,
could answer a word.</p>

<p class='c011'>To be in heaven while yet upon earth, what is
it?  It is to have a sense of security which extends
to the bounds of conception,—and beyond, a sense
which no peril can disturb.  It is to be steeped in
a silent contentment which no words can express.
It is to call the bird your sister, and the sun your
brother.  It is to study how you may serve those
whom you have hated.  It is to say farewell to
those who are dearest to you, and know that they
are not lost.  It is to see the sorrows of earth as
motes in a sunbeam, yet be full of compassion for
the suffering.  It is to know for what purpose you
were created.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Early in the autumn Iona was to go out into
the world, having instructed Tacita thoroughly and
lovingly in all her work, and seen with what a modest
dignity the girl she had thought almost childish
could preside in her place.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was in haste to go, but solely from a conviction
that she was needed elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wherever I am not absolutely needed, I am
lost,” she said.  “My life here is, and has been
for a long time, that of a Sybarite.  I am terrified
when I think of a longer waste.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stay till after the vintage,” they all urged her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will stay on one condition,” she said to Dylar.
“And that is that I may plan, and help to prepare
a house for you and your bride.  Once outside, I
may not be able to come back and see you married;
and it would be cruel if I could have no part.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, Iona, Tacita has not promised to marry
me,” Dylar said, smiling.  “However, do as you
please.  May I ask what your plan is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She pointed to the college.  As we have said,
the building was large and irregular, crowning a
mass of rock that broke roughly toward the town,
and fell sheer on the mountain side, the narrow
space spanned by a bridge from the college gate to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the Ring.  A small part of the structure toward
the town was detached, a point of rock rising
sharply between it and the main building.  The
only mode of communication between the two was
by means of a stair at either side to a mirador built
on the top of this point of rock, and a narrow gallery
hung over the steepest fall of the rock.  This
semi-detached portion, containing but four rooms,
was Dylar’s private apartment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“With two large rooms in addition,” Iona said,
“that would make you a charming apartment.
There is yet space enough on the rock if we fill up
that narrow interstice with masonry solid from the
plain.  The two rooms will be large, one a few
steps higher than the other.  They will be very
stately, with the steps and curtain quite across one
end.  Where the stone breaks to right and left, a
stair can start, double at the top, and meeting over
an arch midway, to separate again below.  There
will be space also for a small terrace outside the
door.  It can be made something ideal.  You use
but two of the four rooms now.  The little museum
in the other two can be removed to the college.
There is plenty of room.  This work should be
begun at once, masonry takes so long to dry well.
But as your living-rooms would be the old ones,
you need not put off your marriage till it is quite
dry.  There is no time to be lost.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No one plans like you,” Dylar said. “It will
be charming.  Do as you please.  I will see if I
can find a bride for your pretty house.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>He took his way to the library, where he had
seen Tacita enter.  She was there alone, lighting
up a shadowed corner with her fair face and golden
hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a very studious face at that moment.
Her arms stretched out at either side of a large
volume, she read attentively.  Other books were
piled at right and left.  Now and then she put
her hand to her forehead, then made a note on a
long strip of paper, writing with a serious carefulness.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was preparing a lecture on history for the
youngest class of girls in that study.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be to the great complex subject what a
globe with the great circles only is to the whole
geography of the earth.  It must be as though, on
that globe with its few lines, you should draw at
one point a little black circumflex, and say: ‘Here
is found the asp of the Nile.  The monarchs wore
it in jewels on their diadem.  One laid it alive on
her breast, and died.  And here, where this black
line goes past, and never stops, but always returns,
the Wise Men of the East found the Infant Christ.
And here grow roses, oh, such roses! in full fields,
to make the precious attar of.  And here grows the
pink coral, like that coral rose Iona wears.  No;
the lesson must not be dry, nor yet too rich.  It
must make them wish for more.  Only a few
sparse sweetnesses.  O land of France, what noblest,
fairest deed for children to hear was ever
done on your soil since you were France?’”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>So the young student was thinking, deep buried
in her study, when she heard a voice say:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“O Minerva, may I come in?  Is there a gorgon
on your shield of folios?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked up with a glad welcome.  “Not for
you.  You are come in good time, perhaps, to
check my wild ambition.  Do you know, prince,
that I aspire to become an historian?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I come indeed in good time,” he said.
“For it is a history which I wish you to write.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked inquiringly; but he did not meet her
glance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you come out to the terrace?” he said,
indicating the one near them toward the college.</p>

<p class='c011'>And as they went, he said reproachfully: “You
hide yourself from me.  I find you always surrounded.
You seem to like me less and less every
day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita’s lips parted.  “Shall I tell him that I
like him more and more?” she thought.  “No.
Yet he must be satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know what reply to make,” she said,
somewhat breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know what to think?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would it pain me to know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He smiled, even laughed a little; she had said,
in fact, so much more than she was aware.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look at the college,” he said. “Iona has a
plan of a house there for me.” He explained it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“She will remain till vintage time to see it well
started. Will you go there and live with me, Tacita,
when it is done?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes!” she said quietly, her eyes on the college.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you go next Easter?” he asked, after a
pause.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes!” she said again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God’s blessing on you!” he exclaimed fervently.</p>

<p class='c011'>They stood a moment longer in silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then: “Shall I go back to my writing?” asked
Tacita, looking at Dylar with an expression of
entire contentment and confidence. And when he
answered her smile, and bowed assent, she left him
there, to build up his house with one swift flash of
fancy, to bring his bride home rose-veiled, to draw
from her reluctant lips all that they now refused to
tell, to tear himself away presently with only a few
gentle words, and not even a pressure of the hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have made me very happy, my Tacita!”
he said. “I leave you now only because I must!”</p>

<p class='c011'>In San Salvador engagements were very brief,
as they could well be between persons who had
known each other from childhood; and whatever
friendly intimacy there might have been between
them before, it ceased in a great measure during
that time. It might be said that courtship was
almost unknown; and between the betrothal and
marriage the couple did not meet alone. Tacita’s
promise, therefore, remained a secret between herself
and Dylar.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>And so the summer passed with no apparent
change in their relations.</p>

<p class='c011'>Autumn was always a stirring time in San Salvador.
The whole town was given up to the labors
and pleasures of harvesting. Every one had some
task. Even the children were made useful. The
vintage, as in all grape-growing countries in times
of peace, was a season of gayety, and all its picturesque
work, except the grape-gathering, was done in
that part of the outside road, or cornice, between
the Arcade and the kitchens. A crowd of children
were seated here in groups on straw mats, with
awnings over them. Boys and men brought huge
baskets of grapes supported on poles over their
shoulders. In the centre of each group of six or
seven was a large wooden tray heaped high with
the fruit which they picked from the stems into
basins in their laps. Women, girls and boys went
about and gathered from these full basins into pails
for the wine presses. Dressed in the stained cotton
tunics of former vintages, their hands dyed
a deep rose-color, the children chattered like magpies.
Even little lisping things, under the guidance
of their elders, were allowed to take a part in
the business, or fancy that they did. Some of the
boys had taken a little two-years-old cupid and
rubbed grape-skins on his hands, face, legs and
feet, till they were of a bright Tyrian purple,
and set a wreath of vine tendrils on his sunny hair;
and he went about from group to group vaguely
smiling, not in the least understanding the mirth
which his appearance excited.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>The boys capered about like goats when free from
their burdens. One of them ran to the Arcade,
turning summersaults, walking on his hands, running
backward, went up the stairs, like a cat, and
appeared in the veranda, cap in hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita was seated there by a little table, making
notes of the harvest as reports were brought her.
The boy delivered his message like a gentleman,
bowed himself out, and became a monkey again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not far from the noisy grape-pickers, under another
awning, were women sorting nuts and olives.
They suspended their work as Iona came down the
street and paused to speak to them. All looked up
into her face with an earnest and reverential gaze.
They had not ceased to wonder at the change in
her, nor had they learned to define it; for while,
in her gentleness and simplicity of manner she was
more like one of them, they were yet conscious of
a superiority which they had never before recognized
in her. It was as though a frost-lily should in
a single night be changed to a true lily, fragrant
and still.</p>

<p class='c011'>She spoke a few words to them, and then went
up to the veranda to Tacita.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stay with me a little while!” said Tacita
eagerly, bringing her a chair. “I think of you all
the time, and cannot keep the tears out of my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona embraced her. “The same hand leads us
both, dear. Do not grieve. For me, I am in
haste to go. You have yourself made me more
eager with your munificent gift.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>For Tacita, with Dylar’s approval, had given all
her little fortune to Iona to be disposed of “not in
doing charity,” she said, “but in doing justice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Iona had replied: “Yes, justice! For
though charity may move us to act, that which we
do of good is but a just restitution.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My heart is in anguish for the world’s poor,”
she said now. “And not for the beggar alone. I
think of those who can indeed escape physical starvation
by constant labor, but whose souls starve in
that weary round that leaves them no leisure to
look about the fair world in which they exist like
ants half buried in sand. I think of homeless men
and women, oh! and children, eating the bread of
bitterness at the tables of the coarse and insolent;
of artistic souls cramped by some need that any
one of a thousand persons known to them could
supply, could understand without being told, if they
had a spark of true human sympathy in their
hearts, but which they behold with the insensibility
of stones. Your fortune, my Tacita, will be a
heaven’s dew to such. For your largess will be
given only to the silent, who ask not. I do not
know the world as well as many of our people do;
but those who have had most experience say that
the almost universal motto acted on, if not confessed,
is the saying of Cain: ‘Am I my brother’s
keeper?’ Now, I wish to have as my motto that I
am my brother’s keeper whenever and wherever
one has need of me. I will have nothing to do
with agents nor organizations. I will see the suffering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>face to face. Wherever I see the eyes of
the Crucified looking at me through a human face,
there will I offer help. The King shall send me to
meet them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are those,” said Tacita, “who will affect
anguish in order to move you. They rob the real
sufferer, and they create distrust and hardness in
the charitable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall sometimes be deceived,” Iona said.
“Who is not? Sovereigns are deceived by their
courtiers, husbands by their wives and wives by
their husbands, and friends deceive each other, and
children deceive their parents. I go with no romantic
trustfulness, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The hour for her departure hastened to come.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the last evening she went to the assembly,
passed through all the rooms, saying a few words,
but none of farewell. Then she went to the Basilica.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rapture of her vigil had subsided; but the
seal of it remained stamped on her soul, never again
to be overwhelmed in darkness. Doubt and fear
were gone forever, and she went on cheerful and
assured, if not always sensibly joyous.</p>

<p class='c011'>It had seemed to her that on this last visit she
should have a good deal to say; but no words came.
What she was doing and to do spoke for her. She
walked about, looking at the temple from different
points, to impress its features on her memory, and
sat an hour before the throne in quiet contemplation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>What her leave-taking was of that sacred place,
we say not.</p>

<p class='c011'>Early the next morning she was seen walking
along the mountain path with Ion at her side. At
the last visible point of the path she turned,
stretched her arms out toward the town, then went
her way.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ion came back an hour later, his eyes swollen
with weeping. “I shall see her in the spring, in
the spring, in the spring,” he kept repeating, to
comfort himself. And when Tacita came to meet
him with both her hands held out, “O Lady Tacita,
I shall go out to her in the spring, in the
spring!” he said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The short southern winter drew to a close.
Everything that could fade had faded. The vines
stretched a network of dry twigs, the olive trees
were ashen, the pines were black. The gray of
crags and houses looked bleak under the white dazzle
of the mountain-wreath, and the dazzling blue
of the sky. Sometimes both were swathed in
heavy clouds, and the town was almost set afloat
in floods of rain.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the time for in-door work, and closer domestic
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last days of this season were given up to
penitential exercises similar in intention to the
Holy Week of the Catholic church, though different
in form,—having, in fact, only form enough,
and that of the simplest, to suggest the spirit.
Like all the instruction given in San Salvador, its
object was less to act upon the passive soul than to
set the soul itself in action.</p>

<p class='c011'>The admonition to these devotions was brief: “At
this time, while Nature sits in desolation, mourning
over her decay and trembling before the winter
winds, let us invite those veiled angels of the Lord,
sorrow and fear, to enter our hearts and dwell awhile
with us. Let us read and ponder in silence the life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>and death of the Divine Martyr. Let us remember
that while we have rejoiced in peace, plenty,
honor and justice, thousands and tens of thousands
of our kind in the outer world have suffered starvation
of body and mind, have been hunted like wild
beasts, and branded on the forehead by demons
disguised as men; and let us remember that that
same Divine Martyr, our King and our Lord, said
of these same children of sorrow and despair: <em>Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto them</em>—whether
good or evil—<em>ye have done it unto me</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The exercises began on Saturday night, and continued
eight days, ending on the second Monday
morning. There was a visit at night to the cemetery
by all but the children, the sick, and the very
aged. On Saturday the children would visit the
Basilica to commemorate the blessing of the children
by Christ, and, strewing the place with freshly
budded myrtle twigs, would ask his blessing before
the Throne. Mothers would take their infants
there and hold them up, but would not speak. “For
their angels shall speak for them,” they said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sunday was kept as Easter, and was a day of
roses; and on Monday morning the whole town,
all dressed in white, would go to the Basilica in
procession, tossing their Easter lilies into the tribune
as they passed, till the sweet drift would
heap and cover the steps and upper balustrades,
leaving only the Throne, gold-shining above a pyramid
of perfumed snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>For up through the dark soil and out of the prevailing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>grayness, already a wealth of unseen buds
were pushing their way out to the broadening sunshine,
to burst into bloom before the week should
be over. The gardens had their sheltered rose-trees
and lily-beds, and every house its cherished
plants, watched anxiously, and coaxed forward, or
retarded, as the time required.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first Sunday was called the Day of Silence;
for no one issued from his house after having entered
it on returning from the cemetery, and each
head of a family became its priest on that day, reading
and expounding to his household the story of
the passion of Christ, the Divine Martyr.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Monday morning, after the procession of lilies,
Dylar and Tacita would be publicly betrothed; and
a week later their marriage would take place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know, Tacita,” he said to her, “if our
form of marriage will satisfy you. It has nothing
of that ceremonial which you are accustomed to
see, though we hold marriage to be a sacrament.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Saturday morning of their Holy Week,
and the two were walking apart under the northern
mountains. They had already assumed the mourning
dress of gray and black worn by all during
that week, and the long gray wool cloaks with fur
collars worn in the winter were not yet discarded.
But their faces were bright, Tacita’s having a red
rose in each cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Elena has told me something,” she said. “And
how could I be otherwise than satisfied? For so
my father and mother were married, and so—you
will be!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>“Our position in regard to a priesthood, if ever
to be regretted, is still unavoidable. Our foundation
was a beginning the world anew, all depending
on one man, with the help of God. No authority
whatever was to enter from outside; but all was to
conform as nearly as possible to the word of Christ;
and as if to atone for any omission, he was elected
King. Our people were of every clime and every
belief; yet they were all won, by love,—not by
force, nor argument, nor fear,—to accept Christ,
and to live more in accordance with his commands
than any other community in the world is known to
do. When any of them go out into the world they
choose the form of Christian worship which suits
them best; and some, returning, have wished to
see a priesthood introduced here. But that question
brought in the first note of discord heard in
our councils since the foundation. Some wanted
one form, and some another. The subject then
was forbidden, and we returned to the plan of our
founder: to live apart, a separate and voiceless
nation, waiting till God shall see fit to break down
our boundaries. On Easter Sunday we lay our
bread and wine on the footstool, opening the gates,
and with prayer and song ask him to bless it, our
invisible High Priest. Then each one, preparing
himself as his conscience shall dictate, goes humbly
up the steps his foot can touch at no other time,
and takes of the sacramental bread, touches it to
the wine set in a wide golden vase beside it, and
comes down and eats it, kneeling. The little square
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>of snowy bread looks as if a drop of blood had fallen
on it where it met the wine. I think that many
a heart is full of holy peace that day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well they might be,” said Tacita. “But of
the marriage, tell me. What have we to do? I
am half afraid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“First, then,” said Dylar, “On Saturday you
lead the girls to the Basilica for the Blessing, as
Iona used to do, Ion leading the boys. On Sunday
you do only as the others. On Monday morning a
company of matrons go for you and take you to the
Basilica for the lilies. All are in white and all
wear veils of white, you like the rest. But you
alone have a lily on your breast. All come out.
You, surrounded still by your guard of matrons,
remain in the court just outside the portal, at the
right, and I, with the Council, at the left. All the
others are below, outside the green. Professor
Pearlstein, as president of the council, then asks
in a loud voice if any one can show reason why I
should not demand your hand in marriage. He
waits a moment, then says: ‘Speak now, or forever
after hold your peace.’ No sound is heard. I
forbid the wind to breathe, the birds to sing!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then?” said Tacita, smiling, as he stopped
and flashed the words out fierily.</p>

<p class='c011'>His eyes softened on her blushing face, and they
stood opposite each other under the lacelike
branches of an almond-tree where minute points
thick upon all the boughs betrayed the imminent
blossom-drift.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“And then,” said Dylar, “I shall come forward
into the path where the lamps of the sanctuary
shine out through the portal, and I shall say: ‘If
Tacita Mora consents willingly to promise herself
to me this day as my betrothed wife, in the presence
of God and of these my people, let her come
forth alone and lay her hand in mine.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>He pronounced the words with seriousness and
emphasis. His tones thrilled her heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then?” she said, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c011'>He smiled faintly, but with an infinite tenderness.
“And then, my Lady, if even at so late a
moment you doubt, or fear, you need not answer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How could I doubt, or fear!” she exclaimed,
and turned homeward.</p>

<p class='c011'>They walked almost in silence, side by side, till
they reached the Arcade, where they were to separate
till they should meet in the scene which he had
just been describing. And there they said farewell
with but a moment’s lingering.</p>

<p class='c011'>That evening all retired as soon as sundown; but
they rose again at midnight and assembled in the
avenue and square, from whence, in companies of
a hundred, each with its leader, they started for
the cemetery.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they went, they recited the prayers for the
dead by companies, the Amen rolling from end to
end of the line.</p>

<p class='c011'>Entering the ravine was like entering a cavern.
But for the sparse lamps set along the way they
could not have kept the path. They went in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>silence here, only the sound of their multitudinous
steps echoing, till a faint light began to shine into
the darkness before them from where, just out of
sight, every letter had been outlined with fire of
that legend over the arch:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>I am the Resurrection and the Life.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>Then from the midst of the long procession rose
a single voice reciting the psalm: <em>The Lord is my
Shepherd</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one, having once heard it, could mistake the
voice of Dylar for any other. It was of a metallic
purity, and gave worth to every word it uttered.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art
with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>As they listened they felt not the stones under
their feet. Solemn and buoyant, into their souls
there entered something of that spirit which has
made and will make men and women march singing
to martyrdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>They passed under the arch, and in at the lower
door of the cemetery. All the doors from top to
bottom were open, and the lamps shed a dim radiance
through the long, hushed corridors of the dead;
but their flames caught a tremor as the breathing
multitude went by, two by two.</p>

<p class='c011'>They ascended inside, by ways that seemed a
labyrinth, to the upper tier just under the grassy
hollow of Basil’s Rest. Issuing there, they descended
by the outer stairs, filling all the galleries
on the eastern side of the mountain. The waning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>moon, rising over the eastern mountains, saw a
great pyramid of pallid faces all turned her way,
a dim and silent throng that did not move,—as
though the dead had come forth to look at the rising
of some portentous star, long prophesied, or to
watch if the coming dawn should bring in the Day
of Judgment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently a murmur was heard. All were reciting
in a whisper the prayers for the dead, each
striving to realize that they would one day, perhaps
not far distant, be said for himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>This multitudinous whisper, the chill of the
upper air, the solemn desolation of the terrestrial
scene and the live scintillating sky with that gleaming
crescent unnaturally large between the eastern
mountain-tops, all made Tacita’s hair rise upon her
head. Into what morning-country did it mount,
like mists from the earth at sunrise, this cloud of
supplicating sighs from out their earth-bound souls?
Were these shadowy forms about her, indistinguishable
from the rock save for their pallid faces,
were they living men and women? or would they
not, at the first hint of dawn, reënter, mute and
slow, those cavernous doors, and lie down again in
the narrow beds which they had quitted, for what
dread expiation!—for what hope long deferred!</p>

<p class='c011'>Not much of earthly vanity can cling to such a
vigil. The ordinary human life, slipped off so like
a garment, would be assumed again, freed for a
time, at least, from dust and stain.</p>

<p class='c011'>When, at length, a faint aurora showed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>east, a choir of men’s voices sang an invocation to
the Holy Ghost as the Illuminator.</p>

<p class='c011'>That song dispelled all fear, and life grew sweet
again:—life to be helpful, joyful, and patient in;
life in which to search out the harmony and worth
of life;—life to grow old in and wait after work
well done;—life to feel life slip away, and to
catch dim glimpses and feel blind intuitions, in the
midst of creeping shadows, of a sure soul-rise in
some other sphere!</p>

<p class='c011'>As they went down, Tacita heard a whisper from
Elena close to her cheek: “‘Dig for your gold,
my children, says Earth, your Mother. Deep in
your hearts it lies hidden.’”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The week of commemoration passed by. On
Saturday the children went in procession for the
King’s blessing, the Basilica all theirs that day.
No one else might enter save Tacita and Ion as
leaders, and the mothers with their infants. Going,
they left the place fragrant with their strown
myrtle-twigs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Easter came and went with its blush of roses
everywhere, its rose petals mingled with the children’s
myrtle on the pavement, roses between the
lamps, and roses in the girdles of the people. The
bread and wine, on silver trays borne by Dylar and
the elders, was set at the foot of the Throne, and
after prayer, and music sweet as any heard on
earth, the people made their communion as the sun
went down, having fasted all day since sunrise.</p>

<p class='c011'>When it was over, Ion walked to the Arcade
with Tacita.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If only Iona were here!” she said. “And now
we are to lose you also. Truly, our joy is not
without a cloud.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What joy is cloudless longer than a hour?”
the boy exclaimed. “For me, it is now hard to
go. Only the thought that my sister is there attracts
me. You were right, Lady! At the point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>of leaving San Salvador, each little stone of it becomes
precious to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not forget that love, dear Ion!” said Tacita.
“And remember, too, that you have left behind
you something tenderer than stones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dylar will bring you to England,” he said.
“I imagine myself running to meet you; and that
comforts me. I cried so when Iona went. I was
like a baby. She made me almost laugh describing
our next meeting. She would appear to me in a
London street. She would be dressed in those
fashions we laugh so at. I must not speak to her.
If I should speak, she would call a policeman. I
told her that I would run and kiss her in the street
if I had to go to prison for it. How glad I shall
be!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He wiped his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning all the people, all in white, a
white wreath round the city, went with their lilies
to the King, till they were piled, a fragrant drift,
up to the very gold, and the lamps shone through
them like stars through drifted snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>All came as Dylar had said, and Tacita was
betrothed to him before God and his people, the
lights shining on them through the open portals
which they reëntered then, but only with a few
chosen ones, to repeat their vows before the Throne.</p>

<p class='c011'>The people waiting outside strowed the way with
flowers; and Dylar led his betrothed to her own
door, and left her there. There was music in the
afternoon, and at twilight the sun-dance in the
Square.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>At last the bride-elect was alone in her chamber,
all the lights of the town extinguished. The
shadows were soothing after the excitement of the
day, and she was glad to be alone. She had refused
to take a candle, and had even blown out
the little watch-light. Yet sleep was impossible,
though she felt the languor of fatigue. A tender
melancholy oppressed her heart. Never had she
so loved Dylar as at that moment. To be able to
dream over his looks and words had been almost
more pleasant than to be with him; for, gentle as
he was, there was something in his impressive quiet
and almost constant seriousness which made her
sometimes fear lest she should seem to trifle. But
now she longed for his presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I could see him but a moment!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She watched a glow-worm coming up her balcony,
its clear light showing the color and grain
of the stone, itself unseen.</p>

<p class='c011'>How lovely had been her betrothal! She went
over it again in fancy, catching her breath again as
when, her guard of matrons parting to disclose her,
she had walked out before the whole town to place
her hand in Dylar’s, and heard the simultaneous
“Ah!” of the whole crowd set the deep silence
rustling. “Why had he not come one step to meet
her? Her eyes were downcast after the flashing
glance that met her own when he had called her
forth. She had not looked once in his face; and
it had seemed to her that, had there been one step
more, she could not have taken it, but must have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>fallen at his feet. True, his hands, both tremulous,
had gathered hers most tenderly; but why
had he not taken at least one step? Could it
have been coldness that kept him fixed to that
square stone he stood on? It was a smooth gray
stone with little silvery specks in it, and a larger
spot at one corner. Dylar’s right foot was a little
advanced to that spot, a neat foot in a black shoe
with a silver buckle, and the edge of his long white
robe, open over the shorter tunic, just touched the
instep. She had not raised her eyes above that
white hem and the border of her own veil.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, why is he not here for one moment!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She recollected Italian lovers. There were
young men in the provinces who, late on the night
before their marriage, went to scatter flowers from
the door of their beloved one to the church door;
and rude people even who went abroad at early
morning would step carefully not to disturb a blossom
dropped there for her feet to pass over. And
then, the stolen interviews, the whispered words,
the sly hand-pressure!</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah! Dylar would never love in that way. Perhaps
he had no ardor of feeling toward her. And
yet—and yet—</p>

<p class='c011'>She smiled, remembering.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was the sound of a step below, and some
one stopped underneath her window. Her heart
gave a bound, half joy and half fright, and she ran
to lean over the railing. No; it was not Dylar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am the college porter,” said a voice below.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“I bring you a note. Drop me a ball of cord, and
I will send it up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She flew to find the cord, dropped it, holding an
end, and in a minute held the note in her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will come back in fifteen minutes to see if
there is any answer,” the man said. “The prince,
my Lady’s betrothed, told me to wait.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After all, it was better so. His presence would
have agitated her. Besides, he was obeying the
rules of the place.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the light to read her letter by! For the
first time in her life, it seemed, she had no light at
hand, and this of all times in her life when most it
was needed. Neither was there a match in her
chamber, nor match nor candle in the ante-room,
nor in the dining-room. “Fool that I was!”
she cried desperately, and ran to the balcony
again. The porter would be sure to have a taper
with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>She spoke; but there was no reply. The man
had gone away.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no reply from him; but was this a
reply, this little lambent shining at her hand?
The glow-worm she had seen was on the rail. As
it lightened, a spot of light like sunshine lit the
stone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita in breathless haste brought a large sheet
of card-board and set it in the blessed little creature’s
path; and when she had enticed it, carried
the sheet to her table, cut the silken thread that
bound her letter, and slipped the page along
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>toward the spot of light that, ceasing for a while,
began again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Turning the paper cautiously, her heart palpitating,
her lips parted with quick breaths, she read
her letter, word by word, till the whole message
was deciphered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot sleep nor rest for thinking of you,”
he wrote. “I have to put a strong force on myself
not to go and speak from under your window. I
am drawn by chains. I have a thousand words of
love to say to you. How can I wait a week to say
them! I have been whispering them across the
dark to you. How you came to me to-day, my
own! I know just how many steps you took, and
I shall set a white stone in place of the gray one
where you stopped.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>She found pencil and paper, and aided by the
same fitful lamp wrote her answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My Love, like you I could not sleep nor rest.
You have made me happy. I have only a glow-worm
to read and write by. Sleep now, and love
your</p>

      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Tacita</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The man came, and she gave him her note; then,
finding her love’s lamp-bearer, she set it carefully
on the railing of the balcony.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dearer than Sirius, or the moon, good-night!”
she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>The marriage differed but little from the betrothal.
It was the only marriage possible in San
Salvador, a solemn pledge of mutual fidelity made
in the presence of God and of the people. Dylar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>came to the Arcade for his bride, and led her over
the flower-strown path to the Basilica, which they
were the first to enter.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a white day, all being dressed as on the
Monday before, except the bride, who was in rose-color,
robe and veil, and the bridegroom, who wore
dark blue.</p>

<p class='c011'>That afternoon they set out for the castle, going
through the Pines.</p>

<p class='c011'>The preparations at the Olives were not less joyous.
It was long since a Dylar had brought a
bride home to them; and they looked on Tacita,
with her white and golden beauty, as an angel.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time the bride and bridegroom lived only
for each other. They had all their past lives to
bring in and consecrate by connecting it with the
new. It seemed to them that every incident in
those lives had been especially designed to bring
them together.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, after a fortnight, they returned as they
had come, and walked over flowers to their new
abode, to finish which half San Salvador had been
like a beehive while they were gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two new rooms were noble and picturesque,
the difficulties of approach had been cleared away,
and the background of the college-buildings gave
a palatial air to their modest home. Whatever
defects of newness there were were covered artfully,
and the whole was made a bower of beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then began their quiet home-life, and the brief
stir of change subsided to the calm of a higher
level.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>The week after their return Elena was to go
out. A dozen little children had been sent out to
different houses, and she would gather and take
them to their new homes. A day or two later,
twenty young men, Ion among them, would go.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was the day before that fixed for the departure
of the students, and all the town was gathered
in the Square, now changed to an amphitheatre,
and roofed with canvas. Professor Pearlstein was
to give the young men a last charge, repeating admonitions
which they had already heard, indeed,
but which in these circumstances would make a
deeper impression.</p>

<p class='c011'>The speaker began gently:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“When a father sends his child on a long journey
in foreign lands, he first provides for his sustenance,
furnishes him with suitable clothing, and
tries to secure friends for him in those far-off countries.
He tells him all that he knows, or can learn
concerning them, warns him against such dangers
as he can foresee.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Having done all this, his anxious love is still
unsatisfied. He follows to the threshold of that
parting, and beyond, trying to discover some new
service that he can render, looks again at the traveler’s
equipments, repeats once more his admonitions,
gives lingeringly his last blessing, his last
caress; till, no longer able to postpone the dreaded
moment, he loosens his hold upon the loved one,
strains his eyes for the last glance, then sits down
to weep.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“But even then, when the first irrepressible
burst of grief is over, he forgets himself anew, and
sends out his imagination in search of the wanderer—in
what vigils! with what fears, what
prayers for his well-being!</p>

<p class='c011'>“While the child, amused and distracted by the
novelties of this foreign life, forgets sometimes the
parent he has left, those sad eyes at home gaze
down the empty road by which he disappeared, or
weep with longing to see him once more. Would
the wanderer’s song and laugh displease him if he
knew? Oh, no! He would rejoice in that happiness.
The only inconsolable anguish that he could
feel would be in knowing that the virtue with
which he had labored to fortify that child’s soul
was cast aside and forgotten.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I did not mean to make you weep. I wish
you to think, resolve, remember, and persevere.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Once more I warn you of the dangers of that
life which you are about to enter. Let not your
minds be swept away by the swift currents everywhere
rushing they know not whither, all human
society rising in great waves on some tidal throe
which may land it on a higher plane, or may cast
it into the abyss, one leader with a blazing torch
striving in the name of Liberty to shut the gate of
heaven, and the other, his unconscious accomplice,
in the name of Order, setting wide the gates of
hell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Trust not the visionary who will tell you that
science everywhere diffused will bring an age of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>gold. Trust not the bigot who will say that knowledge
is for the few.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Trust not those orators who, intoxicated by the
sound of their own voices, proclaim that from the
platform where they stand gesticulating they can
see the promised land. Long since the Afghan
heard just such a voice, and made his proverb on

<p class='c011'>“Wait, and examine. Look at both sides of a
question, before you form an opinion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See what children we were but yesterday.
We thought that we knew the Earth. Complacently
we told its age, and all its story. We told
of a new world discovered four hundred years ago,
of its primeval forests and virgin soil, of its unwritten
pages on which we should inscribe the opening
chapters of a new Genesis. And, lo! the new
world, like the old, is but a palimpsest! Under
the virgin soil is found a sculptured stone; through
the unlettered seas rise the volcanic peaks of lost
Atlantis. The insulted spirit of the past lifts
everywhere a warning finger from the dust. It
points to the satanic promise: <em>Ye shall be as
gods</em>. It points us to the tower of Babel. It underlines
the haughty Jewish boast: <em>Against the
children of Israel shall not a dog wag his tongue</em>.
Samples every one of arrogant pride followed by
catastrophe sudden, utter, and inevitable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the face of such a past, can we make sure
of our stability? We cannot. Beware of pride.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span><em>Unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain
that build it. Unless the Lord keep the city, he
watcheth in vain that keepeth it.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold yourselves aloof from any party that excludes
your King. Bind yourselves by no oaths,
and have no fellowship with him who has taken an
oath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If a man sin, and hurt no other knowingly, be
silent and save your own souls. If he sin in
wronging another, speak for his victim, or bear
the guilt of an accomplice. Do not sophisticate.
You are your brother’s keeper, or his Cain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not bid a sufferer be calm, nor talk of reason
to him while he writhes in anguish. The man
of cold blood may be as unreasonable as the man in
a passion. There is a reason of flame as well as a
reason of snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Remember that freedom means freedom from
criticism as well as from force.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never allow yourselves to think or speak of
the poor, of condemned criminals, or social outcasts
as the dangerous classes. Your nativity forbids.
Justice and mercy forbid. If there is a class
which can truly be called dangerous to heavenly
order and all that is noblest in life, it is that great
stall-fed, sluggish, self-complacent mass which
makes a god of its own ease and tranquillity, shuts
its eyes to wrongs that it will not right, and cares
not what power may rule as long as its own household
is protected. It praises the hero of a thousand
years ago, and is itself a skulking coward.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>It calls out a regiment if its sleeve is but brushed
against, and steps upon a human neck to reach
a flower. Seek not their friendships, nor their
praises, and follow not their counsels. Be courteous,
sincere, and inflexible. Be loyal, and fear
not!</p>

his tapestry. He stands behind the frame, seeing
the wrong side only of his web, and having but a
narrow strip of the pattern before him at a time.
And with every strip the threads that it requires
are given. It is all knots and ends there where he
works; but he steadily follows the pattern. All
the roughnesses that come toward him testify to
the smoothness of the picture at the other side.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“I wish to tell you a little incident of to-day
that clings to my mind. It is but a trifle; but you
may find a thought in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As I sat aloft at dawn, thinking of you and of
what I would say to you, I saw an ant in the path
at my feet carrying a stick much longer than himself.
He ran lightly till he came to two small
gravel stones, one at either side of his path. The
stick struck on both stones and stopped him. He
dropped it, and ran from side to side trying to drag
it through.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For a while I watched the little creature’s distress;
then with a slender twig I carefully lifted
the stick over the obstacles, and laid it down on
the other side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ant remained for a moment motionless, as
if paralyzed with astonishment, then ran away as
fast as he could run, leaving the stick where I had
placed it; and I saw him no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you not understand that I was grieved and
disappointed? The labor, the loss, and the fear of
that little insect were as great to him as ours are
to us. I was so sorry for him that if I had had
the power to change my shape, as fairy stories tell,
and take it safely back again, I would have run
after him as one of his own sort, yet with a tale
marvelous to him, would have reassured him of my
good-will, promised him a thousand timbers for his
dwelling, and a store of food and downy lining for
his nest, when I should have resumed my proper
form and power.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>“Oh! would the ants have caught and crucified
me in the shape I took from love, and only to
serve them!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Children, it is at this very point that the world
will fight with you its most demoniac battle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There have been, and there are, men and
women whose lives shine like those pure flames in
the long, dim corridors of our cemetery, making a
circle of holy light about them, some tranquil and
hidden, some in constant combat. But for the
majority of the race, all the primal Christian truths
have become as worn pebbles on the shores of time.
It is not long since there was yet enough of public
sanity and faith to compel a decent reverence;
but now they utter their blasphemies, not only
with toleration, but with applause. They have an
infernal foolishness that sounds like wisdom to
the ignorant unthinking mind. This spirit puts on
the doctor’s cap and robe and reasons with you. It
twists up a woman’s long hair, and breathes out
brazen profanities and shameless mockeries.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or some being, half saint and half siren, will
praise the beauties of our faith as you would praise
a picture or a song, and smooth away its more austere
commands, so covering all with glozes and with
garlands that there would seem to be no other duty
but to praise and poetize; and you might believe
yourself floating painlessly toward the gates of
Paradise when you are close to the gates of hell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will tell you some of the arguments of these
people.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“They say that Christ taught nothing new, that
his moral lessons had been taught before, and even
in heathen lands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did not pretend to teach a new morality.
He fulfilled the law already given by making
Charity the consort of Justice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it to be believed that the Father of mankind
left his children, all but a favored few, in total
darkness during the ages that preceded Christ?
‘Teste David cum Sibylla,’ sings the ‘Dies Iræ.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“They will tell you that the miraculous circumstances
of Christ’s birth are but a parody on old
heathen myths, that a woman with a Divine Child
in her arms was worshiped by the Indus and the
Nile, and that many an ancient hero claimed a divine
paternity. They will go to the very root of
revelation and tell you that Vishnu floated on
primal seas even as God moved on the face of the
waters; that while the Norse Ymir slept, a man and
a woman grew out from under his left arm like Eve
from sleeping Adam’s side. The fragmentary resemblances
are countless.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our God be thanked that not the Israelite alone,
but even those step-children of the Light had some
sense of his coming footsteps! They had caught
an echo of the promise, for it was made for all. It
was moulded into the clay that made their bodies.
It aspired in the spark that kindled their souls.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have seen the nest of a swallow all straightly
built of parallel woven twigs, except in one corner.
In that corner, in a shoal perspective, was an upright
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>end of pale brown stick shaped like an antique
altar. Two tiny twigs were laid on top as
for a fire, and from them rose a point of bright
yellow leaf for a flame. A pencil could not draw
the shapes in better proportion, nor color them
more perfectly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Above the leaf-flame was hung a cross like a
letter X, which is a rising or a falling cross. This,
floating in the air above the altar, seemed a veiled
interpretation of the sacrifice. Larger, inclosing
all, was an upright cross, the beam of which formed
one side of a triangle, the figure of the Trinity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These figures were laid, one over the other, increasing
in size from the altar outward, the victim
announced, the mode of his sacrifice hinted, and
his divinity proclaimed,—all the emblems of Christianity
plainly and chronologically set. What
breath of the great all-pervading harmony blew
these symbols to the beak of a nesting bird!</p>

<p class='c011'>“From the first records that we possess of human
life, a divine legend or a divine expectation looms
before the souls of men, vague as to time, sometimes
confused in outline, but ever striking some
harmonious chord with their own needs and aspirations,
and with the visible world about them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See those southern mountain-tops half hidden
in a fleet of clouds just sailing over! Even we
who know those heights from infancy can scarce be
certain what is rock and what is mist in all those
outlines. A cliff runs up in shadow, and masses
of frowning vapors catch and carry its profile almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>to the zenith. There is a rounded mountain
where the snow never lingered; and a pile of snowy
cumuli has settled on its grayness, and sharpened
itself to a fairy pinnacle to mock our ice-peaks, and
sifted its white drifts into crevices downward, and
set its alabaster buttresses to confuse our knowledge
of the old familiar height. Yonder where the
White Lady has stood during all the years of our
lives, pure and stainless against the blue southwest,
a dazzling whirl of sun-bleached mists has usurped
her place, leaving visible only her pedestal wreathed
about with olive-trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if you watch awhile the slowly moving
veil, gathering with care each glimpse of an unchanging
outline, you can build up again the solid
mountain wall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So the heathen, yes! and the Jew also, saw
the coming Christ. Anubis, Isis, Osiris, Buddha,
Thor,—they had each some inch-long outline, some
divine hand-breadth of truth running off into fantastic
myth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Were they content with their gods, those puzzled
but reverent souls? No; for they were ever
seeking new ones, or adding some new feature to
the old. Their Sphinx, combining in herself the
forms of woman and lion, dog, serpent, and bird,
seemed set there to ask, What form will the Divine
One choose? Are these creatures all the children
of one primal mother? Of what mysterious syllogism
is the brute creation the mystical conclusion?</p>

<p class='c011'>“The German Lessing has well said that ‘the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>first and oldest opinion in matters of speculation
is always the most probable, because common sense
immediately hit upon it.’ And, converging to the
same conclusion, an English writer, borrowing,
however, from the Greek, has said that ‘both Philosophy
and Romance take their origin in wonder;’
and that ‘sometimes Romance, in the freest exercise
of its wildest vagaries, conducts its votaries
toward the same goal to which Philosophy leads the
illuminated student.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The early ages of the world were ages of romance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In this supreme case, Imagination, with her
wings of a butterfly and her wings of an eagle,
soared till her strength failed at a height that was
half heaven, half earth. To this same point philosophy
climbed her slow and cautious way. They
found Faith already there, waiting from the beginning
of time at the feet of the God made Man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Again, these apostles of skepticism will tell
you that the superstitions of the time, and the
prophesies concerning Christ, favored his pretensions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Christ had been an impostor, or self-deceived,—the
King’s Majesty pardon me the supposition!—in
either case he would have striven to
conform as much as possible to the prejudices of
that expectation; and he would have taken advantage
of the popular enthusiasm, as impostors and
visionaries do. Instead of that, he set up a pure
spiritual system and acted on it consistently, <em>obedient</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>(the Scripture says) <em>unto death</em>. He flattered
no one. He boldly reproved the very ones whose
support he might naturally have desired. In the
height of his fame he predicted his martyrdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor was that time more superstitious than the
present, nor the followers of Christ more credulous
than people of to-day, and not among the ignorant
alone. It is, in fact, notable how many proofs
they required. I should say that the Apostles were
hard to convince, considering the wonders they had
seen. How many times had Jesus to say to them,
<em>O ye of little faith!</em></p>

<p class='c011'>“When the women went to the sepulchre, it was
not to meet a risen Lord, but to embalm and mourn
over a dead one. When Mary Magdalen went to
tell the Apostles that Jesus had risen, her words
<em>seemed to them an idle tale, and they believed it not</em>.
But Peter went to see. <em>He ran</em>, Saint Luke says.
He saw the empty grave, the linen cloths laid by;
and he went away <em>wondering</em>, not yet believing,
though Magdalen had testified to having seen and
spoken with Jesus, and had given them a message
from him, though he had predicted his own resurrection,
and though Lazarus and the ruler’s
daughter were still among them. Does this look
like credulity?</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not for the present to reproach the past
with superstition, now when every wildest fantasy
flourishes unchecked. Some turn their longing
eyes back to the old mythologies. Like the early
Christian gnostics, they like to flatter themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>by professing an occult worship which the vulgar
cannot understand, and building an inner sanctuary
of belief where chosen ones may gather, veiled from
the multitude. It is scarcely an exaggeration to
say that the day may not be far distant when, in
lands called Christian, temples and altars may
again be erected to Jove, Cybele, Diana, Osiris,
and the rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The mind, like the body, may, perhaps, feel
from time to time a need to change its position.
But the body, in all its movements, seeks instinctively
to keep its equilibrium. The equilibrium
of the soul is in its position toward its Creator.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The paganism of to-day has this evil which the
earlier had not: it is a step in a descending scale.
In those other days mankind seemed to be rising
from the abyss of some immemorial disaster, of
which all nations have some fragmentary tradition.
In Christ the human race reached its climax. He
was the height of an epoch which now, perhaps, declines
to a new cataclysm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Again, the skeptic tells you that there were
and are no miracles. Presumptuous tongue that
utters such denial! How do they know that there
are no miracles?</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what is a miracle? Is it necessary to set
aside a law of nature in order to perform a miracle?
Was not he who made the law wise enough to so
frame it that without infringement he could perform
wonders? The miracle of one age is the
science of the next. Men do to-day without exciting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>wonder what a few centuries ago would have
consigned them to the stake as magicians.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The miracles of Christ were the acts of one
having a perfect knowledge of the laws of the universe,
and are a stronger proof of his divinity than
any invasion of those laws could be. It was miraculous
that a seeming man should have such
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Another criticism of religious teachers in both
the old and the new law is their ignorance of physical
science, evident by commission as well as by
omission. Whether they knew or not, common
sense alone should teach us that if any one announcing
a new religious truth should disturb the
preconceptions of his hearers regarding physical
truths he would in so much distract their attention
from that which he wished to teach them; and
their credulity, under this double attack, might fail
to accept anything.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Juvenal’s dictum, ‘bread and games,’ for the
government of a people, is true of all mankind in
a higher sense. Physical science is man’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">circenses</span></i>.
It exercises his intellect, amuses him and
his kind, and every new discovery should excite in
him a higher admiration of the Creator. It was
not necessary that the Son of God should become
man, or rise from the dead in order to teach the
movements of the starry spheres, or the secret
workings of terrestrial powers. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Circenses!</span></i></p>

<p class='c011'>“What matters it to the interests of man’s immortal
soul if the earth is a stationary platform, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>a globe rolling through space with a double, perhaps
a triple motion! What cares the dying man
for the powers of steam, or electricity, or the laws
of the ways of the wind! <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Circenses! Circenses!</span></i></p>

<p class='c011'>“Christ came to bring the bread of life, the
heavenly <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Panem</span></i>, without which there is no life
nor growth for the spirit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My children, you are counseled to patience and
gentleness. But listen not in silence when any one
reviles your King. Say little to them of the God,
lest they blaspheme the more; but say, <em>Behold
the man!</em> It is not pious people alone who have
lauded him, nor theologians only who have borne
testimony to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Napoleon I., a warrior, an eagle among men,
said of Jesus Christ: ‘I know man, and I tell you
that Christ was not a man. Everything about
Christ astonishes me. His spirit overwhelms and
confounds me. There is no comparison between
him and any other being. Alexander, Cæsar,
Charlemagne, and I have founded empires; but on
what rests the creation of our genius? On force.
Jesus alone founded his empire on love.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will find no peer of Napoleon I. among
those who can see no greatness in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Carlyle says of Christ that he was ‘the highest
soul that ever was on earth.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such names will more impress the mocker
than will the name of saint or apostle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bid them look at his humility when he was personally
criticised, and at his sublime assumption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>when proclaiming his mission. <em>I am the Light
of the world. I am the resurrection and the
life. All power is given unto me in heaven and
on earth.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>“Did any other teacher of men ever utter such
words? See him with the scourge in his hand!
See him with the lily in his hand!</p>

<p class='c011'>“O happy blossom! to be so looked at, touched
and spoken of. Did it fade away as other blossoms
do? Does its seed yet live upon the earth?
Does the Syrian sunshine of to-day still paint the
petals of its almost nineteen hundredth generation?</p>

<p class='c011'>“How dare these preachers of destruction try
to rob the human race of such a teacher? What
have they to give in exchange for him? Who
among them all has a message that can gild the
clouds of life, and make of pain and of obscurity
a promise and a crown? Never in our era as now
has there been such temporal need of the softening
influences of Christianity. The poor and the oppressed
of all the world, maddened by suffering
and insult, outraged by hypocrisy and deceit, are
rising everywhere with the desperate motto almost
on their lips, <em>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow
we die</em>. A Samson mocked at by fools and fiends,
their arms grope blindly out, searching for the pillars
of a corrupted state.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And this is the moment chosen to dethrone the
Peacemaker of the universe! Verily, whom the
gods would destroy they first make mad!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“Will teachers like these incite men to heroic
deeds? They destroy honor and heroism from off
the face of the earth! They forge their chains and
lay their traps for anarchy; yet there is no preacher
of anarchy so dangerous, even for this life, as he
who seeks to dethrone in the hearts of men their
martyred Lover, Jesus of Nazareth!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man paused, and, with his eyes fixed far
away over the heads of the audience to where the
sky and mountains met, lifted his arms in silent
invocation. Then, drooping, he came feebly down
from the pulpit.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boys for whom his address had been especially
meant pressed forward to receive him, and
conduct him to a seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were gone; and San Salvador resumed its
usual life, too happy to have a history. A messenger
went out and a messenger came in once a
month, and Dylar held in his hand the threads of
all their delicate far-stretching web.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona before going had obtained his approval of
some of her plans, which were in fact his own, and
the first messenger from her went directly to the
Olives, where he bought a large tract of land.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not seek now to preserve a compact territory,”
she said. “You may find yourself hemmed
in. Buy some of the rising land southward along
the river, and let the next purchase connect it with
the Olives. Let that connection be made as soon
as possible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Iona has force and foresight,” Dylar said. “It
is well. I sympathize with her impatience. But
I know my duty to be more one of conservation
than of enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After leaving his wife for a week, which he spent
at the castle, “I have bought land all along the
river for two miles,” he told her; “and our friend
has bought a tract crossing mine, but not joining
it. It is sand and stones; but planted first with
canes, can be coaxed to something better. Water

it was with the Israelites. I thought of them as I

to me as never before, that a spring of water is one
of the most beautiful things on earth, to the mind
as well as the eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad that you have gratified Iona’s first
expressed wish,” his wife said. “Naturally, the
first wind of the world in her face fanned the idea
to a flame. She is now occupying herself with
other thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona was occupied with other thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us take two or three glimpses of her through
a clairvoyant’s mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a wretched-looking street in an old city. A
lady and a policeman stand on the sidewalk at an
open door, inside which a stair goes up darkly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Said the man:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“You had better let me go up with you, lady.
She’s always furious when she is just out of jail.
We find it best to let her alone for a while.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would rather go up alone,” the lady said.
“Is the stair safe?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s no one else will touch you,” said the
policeman. “It is the room at the head of the last
stair. I will stay round till you come down. But
you must be careful. She doesn’t like visitors,
especially missionaries.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady went upstairs. There were three dirty,
discolored flights. She tapped once and again at
the door of the attic chamber; but there was no
response. She opened the door.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>There was a miserable room where everything
seemed to be dirt-colored. In one corner was a
bed on the floor. There was not a thread of white
about it. From some rolled-up garments that answered
for a pillow looked out a wild face. The
dark hair was tangled, the face hollow, dark circles
surrounded the eyes. “What do you want?” came
roughly from the creature as the door softly opened.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me come in, please!” said a quiet voice.
“I have knocked twice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you want?” the voice repeated yet
more roughly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady came in and closed the door behind
her. She stood a moment, hesitating. Then,
hesitating still, approached the bed, step by step,
saluted again fiercely by a repetition of the question,
“What do you want?” the woman rising on
one elbow as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>The visitor reached the side of the pallet. She
was trembling, but not with fear. She fell on her
knees, uttering a long tremulous “Oh!” and leaning
forward, clasped the squalid creature in her
arms, and kissed her on the cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>The woman tried to push her away. “How dare
you!” she exclaimed, gasping with astonishment.
“Do you know what I am? How dare you touch
me? I am just out of jail!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You shall not go there again, poor soul!” the
lady said, still embracing her. “Tell me how it
came about. Was not your mother kind to you
when you were a child?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>The woman looked dazed. “My mother!” she
said. “She used to beat me. She liked my
brother best.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” said Iona.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another scene. It is a fine boudoir in a city in
the New World. A coquettishly dressed young
woman reclines on a couch. Before her, seated in
a low chair and leaning toward her, gazing at her,
fascinated, is a young man scarcely more than half
her age. At the foot of the couch is a tall brasier
of wrought brass from which rises a thread of incense-smoke.
Heavy curtains half swathe two long
windows opening on to a veranda that extends to
the long windows of an adjoining drawing-room.
In one of these windows, nearly hidden by the curtain,
sits another lady with a bonnet on. She looks
intently out into the street, as if watching some one,
or waiting for some one. The curtain gathered before
her head and shoulders, leaves uncovered a fold
of a skirt of dark gray, and a silver chatelaine-bag.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope that you will conclude to choose journalism,”
said the lady on the lounge, continuing a
conversation. “It so often leads to authorship.
And I have set my heart on your being a famous
poet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I, madam!” exclaimed the young man, blushing.
“I never attempted to write poetry. It is
true that when with you I become aware of some
mysterious music in the universe which I know not
how to express.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>The lady smiled and made a quick, warning
signal to remind him of the other occupant of the
boudoir.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am, then, stirring your ambition,” she said.
“I have done more. I have spoken of you to a
friend of mine who is connected with a popular
magazine. That would allow you leisure to cultivate
your beautiful imagination.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How kind you are!” her visitor exclaimed.
“But my principal depends on me; and I think
that I can be useful to him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady made a pettish movement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He can get others to do his humdrum work.
I heard him speak once, and did not like him.
They call him ‘broad.’ Oh, yes! he is very
broad. He reminds me of one of my school-lessons
in natural philosophy. The book said that a single
grain of gold may be hammered out to cover—I
have forgotten how many hundreds of square
inches. Not that I mean to call your principal a
man of gold, though. Yes, he is broad, very broad.
But he is, oh, so very thin!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man looked grave. “I am pained
that you do not esteem him. Perhaps you do not
quite understand his character.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, you,” said the lady, fixing her eyes on
his, “you seem to me to have great depth of feeling
and profound convictions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was an abrupt rustling sound at the window.
The lady there had risen and stepped out
into the veranda. They could hear her go to the
drawing-room window and enter.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“She is so much at her ease!” said the lady of
the lounge. “She was recommended to me by a
friend as a companion with whom I could keep up
my French. We speak no other language to each
other. But she does not act in the least like a dependent.
I must really get rid of her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A servant opened the door to say that the carriage
the gentleman expected had come.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Must you go?” the lady exclaimed reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I promised to go the moment the carriage
should come. I don’t know what it is for; but it
is some business of importance. I am sorry to go.
When may I come again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To-morrow.” She held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>He took it in his, hesitated, bent to kiss the delicate
fingers, blushed, and turned away.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked smilingly after him, bent her head
as he turned and bowed lowly at the door, and
when it closed, laughed softly to herself. “Beautiful
boy!” she murmured. “It is too amusing.
He is as fresh as a rose in its first dawn and as
fiery as Pegasus.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man entered hastily the close carriage
at the step before perceiving that a lady sat there.
She was thickly veiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg your pardon!” he began.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without taking any notice of him, she leaned
quickly, shut the door with a snap and pulled the
curtain down, and left a beautiful ringless, gloveless
hand resting advanced on her knee. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>looked at the hand, and his lips parted breathlessly.
He tried in vain to see the face through that thick
veil.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady pushed the mantle away from her
shoulders and arms, so that her form was revealed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man made a start forward, then recoiled;
for, hanging down the gray folds of the
lady’s skirt was the silver chatelaine-bag he had
seen in the boudoir. What did her companion
want of him?</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady flung her veil aside.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Iona!” he cried, and fell into his sister’s
embrace.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a moment she put him back, looking at
him reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Ion, so soon in trouble! I heard of you
in the hands of a Delilah, and I left everything. I
obtained the place which would enable me to know
all—her guile and your infatuation. She amuses
herself with you. She has said to me that you are
in love with her, and do not know it. Her husband
is angry, and people talk. So soon! So soon!
Oh, Ion!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She said it!” he stammered, becoming pale.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She said it to me laughing. She described you
gazing at her. She laughs at your innocence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy shuddered. “I will never see her
again!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again the clairvoyant.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a bleak November day in a city of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>North. Pedestrians hurry along, drawing their
wrappings about them. Standing close to the walls
of a church in one of the busiest streets, an old man
tries to shelter himself from the wind. He is thin
and pale and poorly clad, but he has the air of a
gentleman, though an humble one. There is delicacy
and amiability in his face; his fine thin hair,
clouded with white, is smoothly combed, and his
cotton collar is white. On his left arm hangs a
small covered basket, and his right hand holds a
pink wax rose slightly extended to the passers-by,
with a patient half smile ready for any possible
purchaser.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a week he had stood there every day, cold,
weary and tremulous with suspense, and no one
had even given him a second glance. But that he
did not know, for he was too timid to look any one
in the face.</p>

<p class='c011'>The afternoon waned. People were going to their
homes; but the old man still stood there holding
out the pink wax rose. Perhaps the most pitiful
thing about him was that what he offered was so
worthless, and he did not know it. Some, glancing
as they passed, had, in fact, laughed at his flower
and him.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length a lady, walking down the other side of
the street, caught a glimpse of him. She stopped
and looked back, then crossed over and passed
him slowly by, giving a sidelong, searching look
into his face. Having passed, she turned and
came back again.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“Have you flowers in the basket also, sir?” she
courteously asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>He started, and blushed with surprise and agitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” he said, and opened the little basket with
cold and shaking fingers, displaying his pitiful
store.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is your price for them all?” the lady
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>He hesitated, still trembling.  “If you would
kindly tell me what you think they are worth,” he
said.  “I do not know. My daughter made them
when she went to school.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does she make them now?” the lady asked,
taking both rose and basket from his hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>A look of woe replaced his troubled smile.  “She
is dead!” he said with a faint moan.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you other children?” was the next question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.  My daughter left a little girl who lives
with us, my wife and me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you be satisfied with this?” the lady
asked, and gave a larger sum than the old man
had dreamed of asking.  “If you think they are
worth more, please tell me so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t expect so much,” he said.  “It was
my child’s hands that gave them their value to
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tears ran down his cheeks.  He tried to restrain
them, and to hide that he must wipe them
with his sleeve.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>The lady slipped a folded handkerchief into his
hand. “Farewell, and take comfort,” she said
hastily. “God will provide.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned to a man who had followed, and
paused near her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Find out who he is, what he is, and where he
lives, and tell me as soon as possible,” she said in
a low voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same evening, in a suburb of the city: a
little unpainted cottage, black with age, set on a
raw clay bank.  A railroad has undermined the
bank and carried away the turf.</p>

<p class='c011'>A faint light showed through one window.  In
a room with a bed in one corner an elderly woman
was making tea at a small open fire of sticks.  In
the adjoining kitchen Boreas reigned supreme. All
the warmth that they could have was gathered in
this room, where the child also would sleep on an
old lounge.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sat in the corner of the chimney now, wistfully
watching the preparations for supper.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the other corner sat her grandfather.  He
had taken a blanket from the bed and wrapped it
round him.  He was shivering.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was hard to part with the flowers,” the man
was saying.  “They were all that we have left of
her! But to a person like that,—a lady, a Christian,
an angel!—it seemed like giving them to a
friend who will keep them more safely than we
can.” He choked, and wiped his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said the wife drearily; “we must economize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>the money she gave you for them. We have
nothing else to sell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were silent, trying not to think, and daring
not to speak.  They had once been in comfortable
circumstances; and now beggary stared them
in the face, and the horror of the almshouse loomed
before them, not for themselves alone, but for the
child.  If they found a home for her, she might not
be happy there; and they would see her no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly the old man burst out crying. “I
can’t stand it!” he sobbed.  “I can’t stand it!  I
almost wish I hadn’t seen the lady.  I was growing
hardened.  I was forgetting that any one had ever
addressed me as a gentleman.  It was becoming
an ugly dream to me, all this downfall!  And she
has waked me up!” He sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t! Don’t!” said the woman. “And there
is some one knocking. Nellie, take the candle, and
go to the door.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man got up, throwing the blanket from
his shoulders; and the two stood in darkness, holding
their breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a murmur of voices at the door, and
the candle came shining into the room again, and
steps were heard, both light, as if two children
were about to enter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then a lady appeared on the threshold, looking
in eagerly with bright eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ’tis you, sir!” she said. “I am sure that
you expected me.  I am so glad to have found you!
Your troubles are all over!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>One more glimpse through space.</p>

<p class='c011'>A train of cars is going through the Alps, from
Lugano southward.  Four persons occupy one of
the easy first-class compartments.  There are two
talkative ladies in the back seat who seem quite
willing to dazzle the gentleman sitting opposite
them.  He has an interesting face, an athletic
frame, and gray eyes that are at once enthusiastic
and laughing.  When serious, the face is very serious,
and the attitude changes a little, assuming
more dignity.  He is evidently enchanted with
the scene, for he smiles faintly when lifting his
eyes to the snowy heights with their cascades, or
leaning close to the window to see the green waters
below dashed into foam among the rocks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once he glanced at the ladies before him as if
for sympathy, but perceiving none, restrained some
expression of admiration which he had seemed
about to utter.</p>

<p class='c011'>More than once he glanced at a lady who sat in
the farthest corner of the compartment, looking out
in the opposite direction.  She had a somewhat
dusky oval face, dark eyes with long lashes, and
black hair heavy about the forehead.  She looked
like a grand lady, though she was traveling alone.
She wore a simple costume of a dark dull purple
and a full scarf of yellow-tinted lace loosely tied
around her neck.</p>

<p class='c011'>She took no notice of her traveling companions.
The wild grandeur of the scene was reflected in her
uplifted eyes, and woke an occasional sparkle in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>them; but she seemed not strange to the mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once, when the rock wall shut close to her side
of the carriage, she turned toward the other side,
just skimming the three strangers with a glance.
At that moment their progress unrolled an exquisite
mountain picture, and the gentleman turning
toward her quickly, they exchanged an involuntary
smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never was so enamored of the Alps as some
people are,” said one of the other ladies to her
companion.  She had caught this sign of sympathy.
“They are so theatrical.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her friend laughed.  “You remind me,” she
replied, “of the man who said that there was a
good deal of human nature in God.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The stranger lady started.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The one who had spoken shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c011'>The gentleman changed his seat for one opposite
the stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam,” he said, removing his hat, “if you
will not allow me the liberty of expressing to you
the delight I have in these mountains, I shall be
forced to soliloquize.  I find it impossible to contain
myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Speak freely, sir!” she said with a pleasant
look, but some stateliness.  “If I were not a
daughter of the mountains, I think this scene would
force me to speak, if I had to soliloquize.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have never been here before,” the gentleman
said. “I had not known that Mother Earth could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>be so beautiful, so eloquent.  Does she not speak?
Does she not sing?  Who will interpret to us her
language, her messages?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Once upon a time,” the lady said, “a saintly
ruler showed his people a grain of gold that had
been dug out of a wild rough place in the earth;
and he told them that where he found it the earth
had given him a message for them.  It was this:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Dig for your gold, my children! says Earth,
your Mother. Deep in your hearts it lies hidden.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>The gentleman looked out of the window in silence
for awhile. Then he opened a hand-bag that lay
on the seat by his side, and wrote a few words in a
note-book there.  The book was a little red morocco
one, with the name Ludwig von Ritter in
gilt letters on the cover.</p>

<p class='c011'>They spoke of the scenery as they went on, and
presently approached a station.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall in future take my recreation in traveling,”
the gentleman said.  “I have heretofore taken
it in the social pleasures of Paris or Vienna.  One
spends time very gayly in either of those capitals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady was silent a moment, then murmured
as if to herself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">E poi?</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked at her with a smile.  “Why, then,”
he said, “it is true that one sometimes has a headache,
and is willing to resume one’s duties.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The train drew up.  The lady called a porter,
and, with a courteous but distant salutation to the
gentleman, departed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When spring came round again, Tacita was a
mother, having given birth to the tenth Dylar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now we say a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater Noster</span></i>,” she said.
“Is there more than a decade without change?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Becoming a mother, it seemed as if she had ceased
to be anything else.  The most that the people
saw of her was when she sat under the awning of
her little terrace with some work in her hand and
her foot on the rocker of the cradle, her eyes scarce
ever straying beyond the one or the other, and
thinking, thinking.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dylar had removed her decidedly from all outside
duties.  It was the custom in San Salvador for the
mother to leave all for her child; and more depended
on this sunny-faced infant than on any
other.  It was enough for her to train the child, to
note every manifestation of character, to watch
with dilating eyes every sign of intelligence, to cry
out with delight at every mark of sweetness, or
tremble at what might be a fault.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was sometimes astonished at her far-sightedness,
but never at her strength.  He had seen the
steely fibre in her gentle nature even when, a child,
she had mistaken him for a beggar and called him
“brother.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>That strength manifested itself now in the firmness
with which she faced the necessity of soon
giving the child into the hands of others for the
greater part of his education.  Dylar had not the
courage to remind her of this necessity in the first
rapture and tremor of her motherhood.  There
were times when he even asked himself if it might
not be evaded.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Tacita who spoke first, one evening, as she
sat with the child in her arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have fought a battle, and conquered,” she
said, smiling.  “I looked forward to the time when
my son must go to school, and I was jealous.  To
miss him all day, and know that others are listening
while he lisps his first little lessons!  I counted
the weeks and days.  I searched for some way of
escape.  His birthday is in April, and in April it
is too early in the year to have a grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then—would you believe it, dearest?—I
meditated a dishonesty!  The school is dismissed,
I said, for the harvest, and does not open again till
the last week of October.  It would be a pity for
him to begin study and his little industries, his infant
carpenter-work and his small gardening, and
then forget, and have to begin all over again.  He
had better not go till after harvest-time.  I had
my excuses all planned, when I discovered the
little wriggling serpent in my mind.  Oh, Dylar!
What if I should have given the boy a taint of that
blackness which I did not know was in me! I am
not worthy to train him!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>She did not raise her eyes; but her husband knelt
and surrounded both mother and child with his
arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You say that you have conquered, Tacita.  I
had the same battle to fight and had not conquered.
Dear wife, how a spot shows on your whiteness!
What did you resolve upon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This,” she said. “On the very morning of his
birthday, instead of making holiday at home, we
will take him by the hand and lead him to the
school, and his <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">festa</span></i> shall be to meet for the first
time all the dear brothers with whom he is to go
through life, whom he is to help and be helped
by when his father and mother shall be here no
longer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They embraced, and Tacita wiped two bright
tears from her husband’s eyelashes.  “I am impatient
for Iona to come and see the boy,” she said
more lightly.  “Nearly all her letter was of him,
and she comes only to see him.  She thinks that
his hair will grow darker.  I want it to be like
yours by and by; but this gold floss looks well on
a baby.  You must read her letter.  She wishes
me to have a little oil portrait of him taken that
she can carry away with her.  The messenger who
came yesterday is an artist, she writes, and makes
lovely pictures of infants.  She chose him for that
reason.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona appeared to them suddenly on one of those
June days.  She came laden with gifts, letters and
photographs, and had so many messages to deliver,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>and so much to tell, that for several hours of every
day for a week she sat in the dance-room at the
Star-house, to talk with any one who might wish to
come to her.  The rest of her time was spent at
the school, or hanging over the infant Dylar.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who had never been outside could not tire
of hearing her talk, and looking at the photographs
and prints she had brought. These pictures had
been carefully chosen. The sunny beach was contrasted
with the storm-tossed sea; the stately ship,
all sails and colors, with the lonely wreck and its
despairing signal; the beauty of luxury with the
deformity of poverty; the dark street and unclean
den with the palace and garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had faces made terrible by crime, despair,
sickness, shame and sorrow. These to a people
who made health and strength a virtue were her
most effective antidote against any allurements of
that larger life that held such perils.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is worse than I thought, my friends,” she
said to Tacita and Dylar.  “Perhaps the world
never was any better; but it is worse than I thought.
It is not so much the wickedness of the smaller
number, but the carelessness of the majority.  Nothing
but a calamity stirs them up.  Nothing but
a danger to themselves sets them thinking of others.
The prosperous seem really to believe that
prosperity is a virtue and misfortune a vice. Oh,
if they only knew the delight of helping the needy,
and helping in the right way, not thinking that by
a gift you can buy any person’s liberty, or that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>gratitude for any assistance whatever should bear
the strain of any assumption the helper may be
guilty of, but giving outright, helping outright,
and forgetting all about it.  There is no pleasure
like it.  Much is said of ingratitude: far more
should be said of the coarseness of fibre in those
who impose a sort of slavery on the recipients of
their favors.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, much as I wonder at the living, I wonder
yet more at the dying, or those who are looking
forward to their own death.  There are men and
women who leave fortunes to the already rich, or
to institutions which are not in need, or to found
or endow libraries which bear their names, while
all about them reigns an earthly hell of poverty to
which they never give a thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now and then one hears of something lovely.
I remember a man in America who, dying, left
money to give a house, an acre of land, and a pension
sufficient to live on modestly, to a number of
homeless women, single or widows.  The only notice
I ever saw of that tender and sympathizing
remembrance of the homeless called it ‘eccentric.’
Most people who give wish to herd the unfortunate
together, making a solid and permanent exposition
of their benevolence which they can describe in the
newspapers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are women doing?” Tacita asked.
“Some things I saw gave me a troubled feeling.  It
was so different from our women here, so noble,
harmonious and restful as they are!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>“It is, perhaps, inevitable,” Iona said.  “I do
not like to find fault with my sisters when they
strive to be something better than dolls.  Every
transition state is disagreeable.  I hope that, having
made the circle, they may come back to a
higher plane of the same hemisphere they have occupied
in the past.  At present many are ruining
what they propose to regenerate.  Boasting that
they will bring back the lost Paradise, they go no
farther than Cain, the serpent, and partial nakedness.
Woman as a law-maker is meddlesome and
tyrannical.  She goes too much into detail.  There
is a pertness and shrillness in their way of bringing
in the millennium which irritates my nerves.  They
won’t let you alone.  They nag at you.  With some,
you cannot speak in their presence without repenting
of having opened your mouth.  You deplore
the evils of society, and they call you a pessimist;
you praise the beautiful, the sublime, and discern a
rainbow somewhere, and they dub you optimist;
you venture to touch on some half possibility of
intimations reaching the living from the dead, and
they pin ‘Spiritist’ on your shawl; you surmise
that we cannot be sure that we are to live only one
life upon the earth, and they discover that you are
are a Theosophist, and make remarks about your
Karma.  They have a mania brought from their
jam-pots for labeling things.  It is a relief to
turn from them and talk with a sensible man whose
ideas are more in the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">affresco</span></i> style, and do not
scratch.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>“And then, on some happy day you meet a
woman, <em>the</em> woman, noble, judicial, kind, courageous,
modest and sympathizing, and you fall at
her feet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think that something ideal may result from
this uprising of women,” said Dylar.  “It is crude
now, as you say.  But when they shall have shown
what they can do, they will voluntarily return, the
mothers among them, to their quiet homes, and say
to man, ‘As we were before, we could not help making
many of you worthless.  Now we are going to
make a race of noble men.  We will rule the state
through the cradle.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Like our Tacita,” said Iona with a smile.
“Elena always said that she was fit to rule a
state.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Elena!” said Dylar’s wife.  “I am so
impatient to see her.  It will be delightful to have
you both here together, if but for a day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For Elena was on her way to San Salvador,
and near; and they meant to keep her.  She had
had enough of travel and unassisted labor; and
she was needed at home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you see how our little palm-trees grow?”
Tacita asked.  “We are going to have them set
in the green of the Basilica, after all.  They will
be ready in the autumn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona looked at the young trees thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would like to earn a leaf,” she said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>While they were speaking, three visitors whom
they did not expect were approaching San Salvador.</p>

<p class='c011'>A German, a Frenchman, and an Italian, who had
known each other many years, meeting occasionally
in the society of different European capitals,
had met in Paris that spring, and weary of a round
of pleasures which led to nothing but weariness,
had started off on a long rambling journey.</p>

<p class='c011'>They made no plans except to go to places they
had heard but little of, and to be ready to stop at
a moment’s notice.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the German who had discovered that their
pleasures led to weariness alone; but his friends
readily agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am inclined to think,” said the Italian, “that
the only refuge of civilization is in barbarism.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or in a truer civilization,” said the German.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or in a more robust physical health,” said the
Frenchman.  “So many of our moral impressions
proceed from the stomach, or the nerves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Though the German had given expression to the
unrest of his companions, he was indebted, and perfectly
aware that he was indebted to another for
his own awakening.  It was but a word uttered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>by a stranger whom he had met in travelling
through the Alps; yet the word had often recurred
to his mind.  How many times when contemplating
some act, not dishonorable, indeed, yet worldly,
as he had studied and doubted, a lowly murmured
word had stolen up in his memory: “<em>E poi?</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>In preparing for some reception or fête like a
hundred others, in returning from some dissipation,
in looking forward in his career and planning out
his future life, with what a solemn impressiveness
the quiet interrogation had been heard in the first
pause of excitement: “<em>E poi?</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>Their holiday was almost ended for the three
friends, and they were now on their homeward way,
the line of their travels forming a long loop, now a
little past the turn.  The Italian had a young wife
who might be pouting at his absence; the Frenchman
was a banker, and his partners were getting
impatient; the German was an official on leave,
and his term was nearly out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet when their train drew up for a few minutes
at the lonely station of the Olives, and the Frenchman,
usually the leader in all their enterprises,
exclaimed, “Once more, my friends!  I am sure
that no one ever stopped here before,” the other
two hailed the proposal, and snatching their valises,
they stepped from the carriage just as the
train was about to start.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Italian, one of whose nicknames was Mezzofanti,
or Tuttofanti, was always spokesman when
they were likely to encounter a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">patois</span></i>; but somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>to their surprise, this simple-seeming station-master
spoke both French and English passably.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was an orange-farm twenty miles northward,
he said, but no means of reaching it at that
time.  Fifteen miles southward was a castle, and a
hamlet called the Olives.  The man with the donkey-cart
just leaving the station was going there.</p>

<p class='c011'>A castle!  It sounded well.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mezzofanti called the man and entered into negotiations
with him; and he, after looking the travelers
over with a somewhat critical expression, consented
to take them to the Olives on condition that
they would take turns walking each a part of the
way.  He himself would walk half the distance.
His donkey would not be able to carry them all.</p>

<p class='c011'>He further told them that they could not stop at
the castle, the master being absent; but they could
stop at his house, and could have donkeys to return
to the station the next day.  They would want a
number of donkeys there, as they were expecting
supplies.  He could give them three good ones, so
that they could ride all the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a certain calm dignity about this
man, though his dress was that of a laborer, and his
French imperfect, which won their confidence; and
they accepted his offer.  He had learned French,
he said, from his mother, who came to the Olives
from France before he was born.  He was called
Pierre at home.  It was the name his mother gave
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first part of their road was over an arid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>plain, dull thin grass and a few parched shrubs
spotting the sandy soil; but in the distance was a
mass of rich dark green foliage with keen mountains,
black and white, rising into the splendid
blue above them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The German remembered one who had said:
“I am a daughter of the mountains.”  He never
saw one of those masses of rock and snow rising
into the air without wondering if it might not be
there she drew her first breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man, Pierre, did not know the names of the
mountains.  Some of them had their own names.
That highest peak at the left was called the White
Lady, and was beyond the castle.  The castle was
very ancient, and one part in ruins.  There were
many stories about it.  His mother knew them.
For him, he was content with the present.  The
past interested him but little.  The castle was set
on a spur of the mountains, and quite close to them.
The inner wall of the court was a cliff.  Their
road would lead them ten miles straight to the
mountains; then they turned southward, and after
five miles would reach the Olives, which was south
of the heights and just round a turn.  At the
first turn was a fountain where they could water
the donkey, and rest a little while, if they liked.
There was an old ruined house there where they
usually stopped, going to and from the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did the prince live much at the castle?” one
of the gentlemen asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; he came occasionally.  He lived abroad,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>now here, now there.  He had spent a fortnight the
year before at Castle Dylar with his bride.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, there is a bride!” said the Frenchman.
“What is she like?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man had spoken in a serious and matter-of-fact
way; but at the question a smile flitted over
his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is tall and slender, and white and golden-haired,”
he said.  “She is very silent; but when
she smiles, you think that she has spoken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Italian changed color.  “Do you know her
name—her maiden name?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We call her Lady, or Princess,” the man said.
“I know no other name.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is she from?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, far away!” he replied with a vague gesture.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Italian asked no more; but his face betrayed
excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their road had begun to rise and to be overshadowed
by trees.  After a while they reached
the ruined house built up against the rock, and
they alighted to rest, or look about them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The German exclaimed: “Did you ever see such
a green atmosphere!  I do not think that you will
find such a pine-steeped dimness even in your Italy,
Loredan.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beside the house a small stream of water from
the heights dropped into a trough. Dropping, it
twisted itself into a rope. Overflowing the trough,
it rippled along beside the road they were to follow.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>Pierre drank, washed his face and hands, and
watered his donkey.  The three travelers went to
look at the house.  Everything betokened desertion
and ruin. The door and shutter hung half off
their hinges, and only an upper shutter was closed.
A stone stair went up from the one room below; but
a heap of brushwood on it barred the passage.</p>

<p class='c011'>They pursued their way; and as they went, the
scene softened.  A narrow space of rising grassy
land, planted with olive-trees, interposed between
them and the rocks, which only here and there
thrust out a rude sentinel; and their road, having
risen gradually to the house in the pines, began to
descend as gradually.  The afternoon sun had
been excluded; but now it shone across their way.
Olive-trees quite replaced the pines, and allowed
glimpses of an illuminated landscape to be seen between
their crisped-up leaves.  They rounded a curve
and entered the village.  At their right, under
thick olives that hid all above them, grassy terraces
rose to the castle; at their left were the farms with
great white houses sunk in luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The travelers were enchanted. It was a picture!
It was a paradise!</p>

<p class='c011'>Pierre conducted them to his house, and the
whole family came out to welcome them with a
rustic frankness and an urban courtesy.  There
was the mother of their host, a woman of eighty,
his wife, two tall boys, a girl and a baby.  From
the roof terrace another girl parted the long palm-leaves
to peep down at them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Entering the wide door was like entering a
church.  The only partition of the whole ground-floor
was made by square pillars of whitewashed
masonry which supported the floor above on a succession
of arches.  But the pillars were so large
that they gave an effect of different rooms.  Over
some of the arches curtains were looped to be used
when greater privacy was desired.</p>

<p class='c011'>One corner next the door seemed designed for a
parlor.  Far to the right in another direction could
be discerned a hand-loom and spinning-wheel, and
a stone stair.  Far to the left was a kitchen where
something was being cooked at an open fire, and
nearer, between the white arches, a table set for
supper.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pierre led his visitors up the nave of this strange
house, and up the stair to their chambers.  They
were whitewashed rooms with green doors and
small casement windows, over which hung full
white linen curtains.  Green wooden shutters
were opened outside.  There were no carpets,
only straw mats; yet there was no sign of poverty.
The simplicity was artistic.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the boys went up with them to the castle.
The sun was low, and sent long lines of orange
light across the greensward under the trees.  Three
flights of stone steps led them to the lower hall,
where they waited till their guide obtained for
them the readily accorded permission to see the
castle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is very little to see,” the housekeeper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>said.  “But what there is I will show you with
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They questioned her as they went from room to
room, and by secret passages to the upper terrace.
Was there any pass through the mountains?  Her
replies made them wonder that so intelligent a
woman should feel so little interest in her immediate
neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c011'>She knew of no pass except one far to the northward;
but as the mountains were a group and not
a chain, it did not matter.  Climbing in the vicinity
of the castle had proved so dangerous that the
prince had forbidden it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Italian spoke of the prince and princess, but
learned no more than he already knew, though the
housekeeper showed no unwillingness to enlighten
him.  She was enthusiastic in her admiration for
the princess, but did not hear him ask what the
lady’s maiden name was,—did not or would not.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before going away, the three gentlemen laid
their cards on the drawing-room table; and when
they were gone, the housekeeper looked at them.
She read:—</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Don Claudio Loredan, Venice.</em></p>

<p class='c011'><em>Vicomte François de Courcelles, Paris.</em></p>

<p class='c011'><em>Herr Ludwig von Ritter, Berlin.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>“These must be sent in early to-morrow morning,”
she said.  “A gentleman from Venice!  Perhaps
he may have known the princess.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After supper the travelers went out to smoke
their cigarettes under the palm-tree, and the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>woman, knitting-work in hand, followed them.  She
evidently expected their request that she would tell
them something of the history of the castle, and
complied with it with the eagerness of a professional
story-teller.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The origin of Castle Dylar is wrapped in mystery.
It is believed that an army of builders once
went from land to land building churches, castles,
and monuments of various sorts.  They built fortresses,
and walls for cities, too, and had means
unknown to us of moving great stones and fitting
them cunningly together.  It is believed that Castle
Dylar was built by them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for its owner, we will say no evil of the dead.
His few poor tenants lived in huts, and knew not
how to cultivate the land.  They raised a little,
which they and their beasts shared; and when their
provisions failed, they killed and ate the beasts,
being the stronger and more intelligent.  When
the owner—I know not his name—when he came
here from time to time, often with a number of
companions, they fared better.  But, from father
to son, the master came less and less, till one was
left who came not at all, but sold the castle and
land to a Dylar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, then were the people cared for!  Then
were they lifted out of their misery!  Then did
the land bloom!  The first tree planted by Dylar
was an olive-tree.  ‘I dedicate the land to peace and
light,’ he said; and, gentlemen, peace and light have
dwelt in it to this day.  The stupid children of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>tenantry were taught.  Men came and built these
houses to last a thousand years, and then another
thousand.  They dug a hole to let the river through
the mountains.  They cultivated land.  Men did
great works, and went away when they were paid;
but other men and women came in, one by one and
two by two, and dwelt here.  They were children
of sorrow chosen out of the world to come here and
live in peace.  We have all that we want, and we
know not drouth.  The sun and the snow-peaks fill
our cups to overflowing.  When the land grows
dry, our men set donkeys to turning the great wheel
you see yonder, with a bucket at every spoke; and
they fill a tank that sends out little rivulets running
over all the land.  They go to every plant
and tree, like mothers giving drink to their children.
We know not drouth; and Christ is our
King.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There have been nine Dylars with the present
one.  Each Dylar uses his number to his name, or
sometimes alone.  If a written order had the figure
nine alone, or nine straight lines signed to it, that
order would be obeyed.  We put it on all things
for them, too. When our prince was here last
year with his bride, we sent everything up in nines,
nine jars of olives, nine boxes of oil; and the child
who could find a bunch of nine cherries, or a sprig
of nine strawberries to send up to the princess’
table was a happy child.  We sent her a box of
olive-wood to put her laces in. It was fluted in
groups of nine all round, and had nine lilies on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>cover, and a border made of the figure interlaced
and flowering out.  And in the centre of the cover
were the initials J. C., with a crown above them;
for Christ is King of us all.  I found on the jasmine-tree
on our terrace a flower with nine petals,
which was a wonder; for they have usually only five
or six, sometimes only four.  The princess pressed
the flower to keep, and said it was the prince’s
flower.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Dylar made it a virtue for their people to
be healthy and clean and cheerful.  They gave
them games and pleasures as well as labor.  And
whenever they find a young man, or a girl who has
a gift for some airy kind of work that needs a nicer
study, they send them out to learn.  They seldom
come back to stay; but they come, sooner or later,
to see their old home before they die.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For us, we do many things.  We spin thread
of linen and silk, we weave and embroider and
make laces.  We make wine and preserve olives
and make oil.  We knit hose that a queen has
worn, and would have more.  For we have a silk
farm, and a silk that reels off like sunshine.  And
Christ is our King.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who governs you?” asked the vicomte.  “Of
course your prince, and the housekeeper told us,
three of your oldest men.  But is there nothing
else?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, now and again, some people come from far
away, and ask some questions, and get some taxes,
they call them.  They have need of money, those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>who send.  I know not.  They come and they go.
We welcome them, and we bid them godspeed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if two of you should disagree?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then each tells his story to the Three, and they
decide.  And if they cannot decide, they write to
Dylar, whose messenger comes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if some one accuse you, have you no one
to see that no damaging truth, or no lie, is proven
against you?  Have you no one to speak for you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why should another tell my story for me?
And is it not the truth which all wish to have
proven?  Are we children? or bees?  See, now:
if I prove a lie to-day, and gain a pound of silk by
it, or a gallon of oil like honey distilled, then the
spirits of peace in the air about me are disgusted
with the evil scent of my vice, and they fly away,
and evil spirits, who love an evil deed, come near;
and of three pounds of silk they weave a chain that
binds my thoughts all down to that sin I have committed,
or of three gallons of bad oil they kindle
a lamp in my heart that burns: and the only way
to have peace is to go to him I have robbed, and
say: ‘I lied; and here are three pounds of silk for
the one:’ or, ‘I lied; and here are three gallons of
pure oil for one.’  Moreover, the King, when I do
evil, is no longer my king; but the Dark One rules
over me.  What have I gained, though the silk or
the oil were like Basil’s gold?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is Basil?” asked the German, smiling.
“And what was Basil’s gold?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Basil was a Dylar, one of the first.  It is said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>that he was as wise as Solomon, and could understand
the language of all growing things; that he
knew what the curl of a leaf meant, or the sob of
the wind.  He came and went.  There are wild
stories, that he was borne over chasms.  I know
not.  But he gave his people a message from the
earth that he read in a grain of virgin gold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The German was shaken by a strong tremor.
“The message!  The message!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old woman smiled at his eagerness.  “Listen!”
she said.  “‘Dig for your gold, my children,
says Earth, your Mother.  Deep in your hearts it
lies hidden.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there any other settlement near of the
Dylar?” the German asked impetuously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“None, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One has gone forth into the world from this
place, a woman, tall, dark-eyed, with black hair
heavy about the brows, and a soft voice.  She is a
lady.  Who is she?  Where is she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know no such. There is one abroad who
sings.  She is famous, and she returns no more.
I do not know where she is, nor what name she
sings by.  There are others who are married.
There are two young girls who study.  I know no
such lady. It might be one of Dylar’s messengers;
but she is away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could I learn at the castle?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, no! we do not keep their track.  They
come and they go.  There was one who came last
year.  She was something like your lady.  She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>stayed a week; and she reaped a field of wheat.
She is strong to work in the fields.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The German sighed, and said no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The present Dylar is young, is he not?” asked
the Italian.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes; but little over thirty.  But he is very
serious.  His father was gay till he lost his wife.
Then he never smiled again.  But when our Dylar
came here with his bride last year he was different.
His eyes followed her everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did he call her?” asked the Italian.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He called her Love; nought else.  We called
her princess.  How fair she was!  If you should
tell her a story, when you had ended, it would seem
to you that she had been the one who talked, and
not you.  She has changes of expression, and little
movements, so that she seems to have spoken when
she has not uttered a word.  At the castle they
saved all the hairs that were in her combs and
brushes, and I have a little lock of them that coils
round so soft and shining!”</p>

<p class='c011'>When they went in, the Italian lingered behind
his companions, and detained the old woman.
“Show me the lock of hair you told us of,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>She brought it with pleasure, and carefully unfolding
a paper by the light of a lamp hung against
one of the pillars just inside the door, showed a
glossy golden ring, and lifting it, let it drop in a
long coil.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will give you a gold piece for one hair!” said
Don Claudio.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>“I do not want the gold,” she said; “but you
shall have the hair.”  She drew out two or three
of the shining threads and gave them to him; and
he laid them inside a clasped fold of his pocketbook.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Pierre was to go to the station the next morning
to meet Elena; and in consultation with his
advisers it was decided that he should set out early
and alone.  He could then warn her of the presence
of these strangers.  A considerable quantity
of provisions would come by the same train; but
as a part of them were to be left at the Pines, they
would be brought later in the day.</p>

<p class='c011'>The strangers could therefore go at any hour
they might choose, needing no guide, and leave the
donkeys at the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>The gentlemen set out as soon as they had eaten
their breakfast, and half way to the Pines met
Pierre coming back on foot.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had been taken sick on the way, he said, and
a friend whom he had fortunately encountered
would go to the station for him.  It was a sickness
he sometimes had, and it would last him several
days.  He declined their offer to return with him;
and they took leave of each other, and went on
their separate ways.  But Pierre had not gone
many steps farther before doubts began to assail
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I might have waited there till these men had
gone by,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>He turned the situation over in his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alexander and his wife were the guardians of
the week.  There was no woman in San Salvador
better able to take care of the house than Alexander’s
wife.  She knew every signal, was prompt
and courageous.  Above all, she would do exactly
as she was ordered to do if the skies should fall on
her for it.  And both he and her husband had
charged her not to leave her signal-post a minute,
and to give instant notice to San Salvador of anything
that might happen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I had asked if the door was unbarred,”
he thought uneasily.  It occurred to him that the
men inside would have left San Salvador early in
the morning, before it was known that these strangers
were at the Olives.  Alexander and his wife
had not known it till he told them that morning.
“When he passed the evening before, stopping purposely
that they might observe well his companions,
they had been occupied in receiving orders
from San Salvador, and had not known that he
was not alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>He grew more uneasy every moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course they wouldn’t unbar the door till it
was needed,” he muttered.  “And of course Alexander
spoke to them before he started.  But I
might have waited.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In fact, Alexander had called to the men; but
they were out of sight and hearing.  They had retired
to a more convenient place to wait, knowing
that they would not be needed for several hours.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>“I wish that I had waited!”  Pierre repeated over
and over.  “I could have waited.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He recollected stories of men who had been faithful
even to death to interests committed to their
charge; and when had greater interests been at
stake than this of the secret of San Salvador!</p>

<p class='c011'>Texts of gold wrote themselves in the air all about
him, and on the dark earth under his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>He that endureth to the end shall be saved.</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Well done, good and faithful servant.</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Watch and pray.</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>The guardianship of the house in the Pines was
in the hands of a hundred men, each of whom
served a week at a time, with any one whom he
might choose as a companion.  Dylar himself took
his turn.  The rules were strict. Pierre remembered
them when it was too late.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the three travelers reached the house,
therefore, there was a woman alone on guard, with
strict orders to signal everything, but on no account
to allow herself to be seen nor heard; and
the hidden door was unbarred, and the torrent that
shut the road to San Salvador was turned away.</p>

<p class='c011'>They alighted and tied their donkeys to a post,
where they could drink or browse at will.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My opinion,” said the viscomte, “is that this
old building was not always so innocent as it probably
is now.  It was perhaps a hiding-place for
plunder or prisoners, used by the wicked old family
which preceded the Dylars at the castle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They hung their basket of luncheon to a pine-branch,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>set their bottle of wine in the running water,
and looked about them.  To men accustomed to
the luxuries of civilization, and for a time, at least,
weary of them, there was something delightful in
this superb solitude of rock and tree, this silence
stirred only by the sweetest and most delicate
sounds of nature.  It seemed but a day since a
pushing crowd had surrounded them, the paving-stones
of a city had been beneath their feet, and
the Gleipnir cord of social etiquette had bound
them; and to-morrow again all that world would
possess them, and this scene become as a fairy
dream in their memories.</p>

<p class='c011'>They wandered about a while under the trees,
explored a few rods of the northward road, and
came back to eat their luncheon, sitting on the moss
and pine-needles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Frenchman looked up at the beetling rock
that overtopped the house before them.  “I have
a vision,” he said.  “I am clairvoyant.  I see
through the rock yonder into a long succession of
low caves where you must walk stooping.  At the
entrance of these caves sits ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une blanche aux yeux
noirs</span></i>,’ and all the floor is strewn with ingots of pure
gold.  As you look along the windings for miles,
that gold lights the place up like a fire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I also am clairvoyant,” said the Italian.  “I
see beyond those mountains a happy country where
ambition never thwarts true love, and partings are
unknown.  It is the promised land of the heart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see farther yet,” said the German. “Beneath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>that cliff is your El Dorado.  Beside it is
your Love’s paradise.  But farther yet, hemmed in
by precipices, is a great black castle of which Castle
Dylar is but an offshoot.  There dwells a princess
held in bonds by a fierce giant.  He wishes to
marry her, would give her all the gold you see, and
make her queen over your paradise; and she will
not.  If I could pass this wall, if I could thread
the labyrinth of gorges leading to that castle,  I
should find her there, dark and splendid and stately.
She is as free and fierce as an Arab.  She is as
tender as a dove.  She looks like a goddess.  Her
name is—is—Io.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They ate their luncheon in the green fragrant
shadows.  The viscomte went into the house while
the other two smoked their cigarettes, dreaming
with half-closed eyes, till they were startled by an
excited call from the house: “Come here! Come!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They hastened to obey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have found a secret door!” said the Frenchman’s
voice from under the stair.  “It is surely a
door!  The wall moves.  See! it retreats an inch
or two without displacing a stone.  Let us get
sticks and pry it open.  We are on the eve of a
discovery!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Meantime, San Salvador, unconscious of danger,
was all joyful expectation.  The coming home
of Elena was always a holiday for them.</p>

<p class='c011'>True, Iona was to go out again the next day;
but Iona had never taken the hold on their familiar
life that Elena had always maintained.  Besides,
they had this pleasure connected with her going,
that she would take messages to their friends.
Many were busy preparing letters and little gifts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dylar was busiest of all.  He had gone up to
his cottage, which might still be called his study, to
prepare letters of direction, and plans which would
be supplemented by Iona’s word.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the little terrace of their house sat Tacita and
Iona with the child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spare yourself a little for our sakes,” the princess
was saying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never fear, my princess!” said Iona with a
smile.  “I have a presentiment that I shall come
back here at last to die.  It is the only thing that
I ask for myself.  If I should not be so happy, I
know that you will bring my body back.  It is
pleasant to think of lying asleep in our great quiet
dormitory when one can work no longer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The whole earth should not hide you from us,
nor keep you back!” was the fervent reply.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>“Inaction, or even moderate action, is impossible
with the vision that I have of the world,” Iona
went on.   “You think that you know it.  Ah,
you do not know a thousandth part!  You were
safe in your family, guarded and protected.  What
if you had been poor and friendless?  I tell you
that to such human society is sometimes a society of
wolves and tigers.  Nor is an active and conscious
malignity necessary.  Narrow sympathies, self-complacent
egotism and conventional slavery suffice.
Why, who shall say that a tiger may not rend a
man, or a child, with an approving conscience, if
conscience he have!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Life has become like a cane-brake duel, where
two men enter, each from an opposite side, creeping
and searching for each other with the dagger-hand
drawn back, and the blade up-pointed for the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">stoccata</span></i>.  Ah!  Let us not think of it.  For the
work needed to-day, the soul must not stop to
think, but must march straight on in the name of
God.  I will think of my coming back and of my
rest at last.  It is sweet.  Carry me up at sunrise,
and give me a rose in my hand.  I would that I
could have a palm.  But a rose is the flower of
love; and whether it has seemed so, or not, I have
loved so much!  I have loved so much!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She bent, and softly kissed the sleeping infant;
and rising to go away, glanced back toward the
unseen cemetery.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she looked, a swift change passed over her
face, a keen present interest took the place of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>forward-looking.  Her raised brows fell and were
drawn together.  She was facing the signal-station
connected with the Pines, and it changed as she
looked.  Already they knew by signals from the
castle that three strangers had passed the night at
the Olives, that a messenger was coming in to give
them details, that Pierre was on his way to the station
to meet Elena, and that the strangers had also
gone.  From the Pines they knew that all was prepared
for Elena’s entrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What does this mean?” said Iona.  “Can it
be that Alexander’s wife is alone at the Pines!
Tacita, will you call Dylar?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita went to the gallery from which she could
see her husband’s cottage, and him sitting at
a table covered with papers inside the open door,
and she blew a trilling note on a silver whistle she
carried in her girdle.</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked up quickly, and came out.  It was
the first time she had ever called him down.</p>

<p class='c011'>She waved her hand toward the signal-station,
and he understood, and turned that way.  Another
signal had been added.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Iona.  “Pierre has returned home,
and Alexander gone to the station, against the
rules.  Pierre has sometimes severe attacks of
sickness, and he feels them coming on.  But why
did not they call one of the men from inside, and
send him to the station?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was talking to herself.  Tacita glanced up
the hill, and saw Dylar standing on his terrace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>watching intently the signals.  They changed
again.  The strangers were at the Pines, and the
men from San Salvador were not there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without a word, Iona hastened down and went
to the Arcade.  Half way across the town she
turned to look again.  The whole situation was signaled
now.  The torrent was off, the door unbarred,
the men out of sight and hearing, and three
strangers were at the Pines.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Impossible!” she exclaimed, and began to run.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Dylar reached his house and read the signals,
which had been hidden from him as he came
down, he looked across and saw Iona coming out
on to the mountain path above the Arcade.  This
road ran for half a mile along the rock in sight of
the town.  Then it turned backward and out of
sight, joining the road from the Pines, and that
lower one by which Tacita had come to San Salvador.
Near this junction of the roads was the
water-gate by which the torrent was turned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Impossible!” Dylar also had exclaimed on reading
the signals.  To escape for almost three hundred
years, and fall to-day!  So many accidents
and incidents, so many items of neglect coinciding
to form a crime and a supreme calamity, were incredible!
It was impossible that accident could
do so much.  A vision of treachery rose before his
mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>He ran down to the town where people were
gathering on the housetops and in the streets.  He
called for two of the swiftest runners and climbers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>to follow Iona to the water-gate; and they sprang
out like greyhounds.  It was useless for him to go.
There was nothing to be done but turn the torrent
on again.  He stood silent and white, watching
with a stern face the signals, and glancing across
the town to the mountain path along which moved
Iona’s flying feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>The people gathered about him; but no one spoke.
A vague alarm, mingled with, or alternating with
incredulity, showed in every face.</p>

<p class='c011'>The gate was turned by a beam acting as windlass,
and two men were always sent to turn it on
at the Pines.  It was less difficult than to turn it
off; for when the beam was once started, and the
water got a wedge in, it carried the gate round of
itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona remembered this as she fled along.  She
had not seen the men who were sent to follow her.
They had taken the inner road, which was a little
shorter.</p>

<p class='c011'>From all the road she followed and from the
water-gate, the signals were visible; and running
breathlessly, she yet kept them in view.</p>

<p class='c011'>They changed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The strangers were searching the house!</p>

<p class='c011'>They changed.  The door was discovered!</p>

<p class='c011'>Even at that distance it seemed to Iona that she
heard a sharp outcry rise from the town as that signal
slid out, the first time that it had ever been run
out in San Salvador.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their secret was gone!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>But her hope was not gone.  In ten minutes she
would be at the gate; and it must turn for her.  To
have discovered the door was not infallibly to open
it; or, opening it, there must be some delay.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, the cave was prepared to detain the
strangers a few minutes, at least.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then an awful question presented itself to
her mind.  Should she turn the gate if the strangers
were on the bridge?  What were the lives of
three intruders to the existence of San Salvador!
An insinuating whisper made itself heard in her
heart: “Run and turn the gate.  You need not
look at the signal!”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the voice of the world, the voice of the
serpent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A l’aide, mon Dieu!</span></i>” she panted.  “I will do
no evil.  If we fall, we fall!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Was it the heavenly voice once heard, or but an
echo of it in her memory, which now seemed repeating
those words of miracle: <em>Come unto me</em>—the
<em>well done</em> that had accepted and rewarded her
plea for help!  Her fleet feet skimmed the mountain path,
her panting lungs drew in the mountain
air; but her mind saw once more the golden dusk
of the Basilica, the rich molten coloring of the
walls, the words of God sparkling out here and
there in letters of gold, the Throne and the tiara;
and her soul felt the coming of that Presence which
had filled the sacred cloister.  Half unconscious
of her body, she seemed to be borne along by wings
set in her fluttering temples.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Then the path turned, and the water-gate was
before her.  One swift glance over her shoulder
told that the door was not yet open.</p>

<p class='c011'>Iona ran to the beam, and leaning on it, pushed
with all her strength.  It did not stir.  As she
leaned, she saw the signal-station on the opposite
mountains.  It had not changed. The door was
discovered; efforts had been made to open it; but
it was not open.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a frantic effort she pushed.  The beam
trembled, but did not move.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A l’aide, mon Roi!</span></i>” she whispered, and threw
her whole being against the beam, while her ears
rang, and her temples ached with the strain.</p>

<p class='c011'>It started, moved; the water caught the gate.
Iona was carried along, her glazing eyes fixed on
the signal.</p>

<p class='c011'>The course of the beam ended against a mossy
bank.  When it stopped, Iona’s failing form rested
as if kneeling on the moss, her arms on the beam,
her cheek resting on the moss above it.  And over
her lips, and over the wood, the moss, and the rock
flowed a stream of bright red blood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her head drooped slowly, and she fell asleep!</p>

<p class='c011'>So intense had been that flash and strain of soul
out through the flesh, it might be said that the cry
she had uttered was not more on earth than in
heaven, as she sank and rose upon its threshold,
having earned her palm!</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The whole town, gathered below, waited in an
awful silence.  The shock of this danger had come
upon them like a day of judgment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dylar stood apart, gazing alternately at the signals
and at Iona’s form, the blue flutter of her
garments like a puff of smoke on the mountain side.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one ventured to approach him.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a struggle in his mind.  What should
he do with these men?  A fierce rage was boiling
in his heart toward them.  It was of their own
seeking—the meddlers!</p>

<p class='c011'>A hand was laid on his arm.  Professor Pearlstein
stood beside him.  They were in the Square
near the pulpit, on the front of which were letters
of gold.  His hand still pressing Dylar’s arm, the
old man stretched his staff out and drew it along
the words: <em>Thou shalt not kill</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dylar turned away, and began to walk to and
fro.  He became aware of his people all about him,
and of Tacita, her child in her arms, crouched on a
mat at his feet.  She gave the infant to a woman
near her, and went to link her arm in his.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My Love,” she said, “the torrent is turned.
It was turned before the door was open.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped to look at the signals.  He had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>looked for half an hour.  The door was open; but
the road had first been closed.</p>

<p class='c011'>A murmur of prayer rose trembling.  The shock
had been too great.  The strain was yet too great.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then again the signals changed.  All danger
was over.  The strangers were gone on their way.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet the people waited, only whispering their
thanksgiving.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon came the signal that all was well, and
Elena at the Pines ready to enter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the bells were rung and they sang “Te
Deum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But no one went indoors.  Not till Elena had
come, till all was explained, could they think of
anything else.</p>

<p class='c011'>The messenger from the castle arrived with his
story, and the cards of their visitors.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don Claudio Loredan!” exclaimed Tacita,
looking at her husband.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“Is it our business if there should be something
concealed?” the German asked when called upon
to help pry the masked door open.  “The house is
not ours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His companions, full of excitement, broke out
upon him.  Where was his enterprise, his romance,
his courage!  It was a deserted house.
Perhaps its owners knew nothing of this door.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their excitement was contagious; and he went
with them in search of a lever.  They found saplings
that bent and dry sticks that broke.  But
their determination increased with the obstacles;
and at last the right touch was given, the door was
on the hinge and rolled slowly back, disclosing a
dim descent between walls, with a light shining
across from below.</p>

<p class='c011'>All three recoiled a moment at their own success.
“We enter at our risk,” said the German.  “We
have no right here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The other two went down cautiously, and after
a moment called to him, and he followed.  They
had pried open an old chest from which the lock
dropped almost at a touch, and were eagerly pulling
out the twigs and dry leaves with which it
was filled.  All had the same thought.  Surely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>such pains would be taken only to conceal a treasure.
And it must have been there a very long
time.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of them went up to keep watch while the
other two worked, changing hands; for the chest
was large, and the débris could be removed only in
sifting handfuls.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the bottom was reached, a chorus of somewhat
bitter laughter rose; for there was nothing
there but a few rough stones.  It had evidently
been prepared as a mockery, probably long years
before.</p>

<p class='c011'>They prepared to go on their way.  But first
they went to the mouth of the cave, and outside on
the narrow ledge.  There was no passage.  Only
chasms, precipices, and a dashing torrent that
sprinkled them as it fell, met their eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>They went up, leaving the door open, mounted
their donkeys, and started for the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>At a little distance down through the pines they
met a man and woman coming up.  The woman’s
face was covered with a veil, the man only nodded
in passing them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don Claudio Loredan!” said Elena to herself
when they had passed.  “What in the name of
heaven brings him here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the turn of the path the three travelers
paused to look back at the old house with its background
of mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Farewell, El Dorado!” said the Viscomte de
Courcelles.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>“Farewell, my Promised Land!” said Don
Claudio Loredan.</p>

<p class='c011'>The German paused a moment when the others
went on, looking back dreamily.  “Farewell, Io!”
he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is strange,” he said, rejoining his companions,
“that sometimes on leaving a place or person
one scarcely knows the name of, there comes a feeling
of sadness, almost of irreparable loss.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose,” said the Frenchman, “that the
veiled lady we have just met is one of the exiles
from the Olives.  I wonder if they expect her at
home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was expected.  She was looked for joyously
and longingly.  The people of San Salvador remained
watching all the afternoon.  The men sent
up to follow Iona had not returned.  Doubtless all
three were waiting to accompany Elena.  They
watched the turn of the mountain path, sure that
they would take the outer one next the town.  Spyglasses
were ready to catch the first glimpse of their
coming.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are coming!  They are coming!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The flutter of a garment was visible around the
rock.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacita looked through a glass that rested on a
man’s shoulder.  Her other hand was in her husband’s
arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is Elena!” she said,  “She comes first, and
is on foot.  She holds her handkerchief hanging
straight down at her side.  Now she stops and lifts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>both her arms, then drops them again.  It must
mean grief for the peril we have been in.  The
men follow with the donkeys.  They seem to carry
heavy baggage, or something—  What are they
doing?  There is no one else.  What do they
carry?  O Dylar, where is Iona?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She gave him the glass, her face losing its light,
and growing pale and frightened.  The little company
on the heights was now plainly seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dylar took the glass, looked through it, and
took it away from his eyes.  His face was livid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My God!” he said. “Where is Iona!”</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
